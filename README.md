To run the application, first update the API keys in keys/API_keys.py. 

Then, set the admin password in your .streamlit folder, which can usually be found in your user folder. The file needs to be named as secrets.toml, and the file content should contain: ADMIN_PASSWORD = "your_password". For me, the file is located at: "C:\Users\robhe\.streamlit\secrets.toml"

Afterwards,  run the command:
streamlit run app.py in your command window. The application should now be launched.

Make sure all dependencies from the requirements.txt are installed.
