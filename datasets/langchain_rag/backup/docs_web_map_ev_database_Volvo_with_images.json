No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n38h30m\n\n9 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n24 hours\n\n14 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n12 hours\n\n28 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h15m\n\n41 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h15m\n\n41 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge.\n\nRead more about rapid charging of the Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge on the Fastned website.\n\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge \n \n\n 2 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n266 km\n\n2h 25min\n\n15 min\n\n126 km\n\n1h 9min\n\n236 km\n\n2h 9min\n\n15 min\n\n112 km\n\n1h 1min\n\n 348 km \n (3h 25min)\n \n\n212 km\n\n1h 55min\n\n15 min\n\n101 km\n\n55min\n\n 312 km \n (3h 5min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 392 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 348 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 312 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Average energy consumption and range based on moderate drive style and climate. Real-life values may differ significantly. Pricing information might not be actual for some regions. No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n38h30m\n\n9 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n24 hours\n\n15 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n12 hours\n\n30 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h15m\n\n44 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h15m\n\n44 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric.\n\nRead more about rapid charging of the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric on the Fastned website.\n\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric \n \n\n 2 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n292 km\n\n2h 39min\n\n15 min\n\n139 km\n\n1h 16min\n\n257 km\n\n2h 20min\n\n15 min\n\n122 km\n\n1h 7min\n\n 379 km \n (3h 42min)\n \n\n230 km\n\n2h 5min\n\n15 min\n\n109 km\n\n1h 0min\n\n 339 km \n (3h 20min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 431 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 379 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 339 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n38h30m\n\n9 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n24 hours\n\n14 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n12 hours\n\n28 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h15m\n\n41 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h15m\n\n41 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric \n \n\n 2 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n266 km\n\n2h 25min\n\n15 min\n\n126 km\n\n1h 9min\n\n236 km\n\n2h 9min\n\n15 min\n\n112 km\n\n1h 1min\n\n 348 km \n (3h 25min)\n \n\n212 km\n\n1h 55min\n\n15 min\n\n101 km\n\n55min\n\n 312 km \n (3h 5min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 392 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 348 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 312 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge (MY21), which was available to order from February 2020 until May 2021. \n The previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge \n(MY21)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n34h30m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n21h30m\n\n15 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h45m\n\n31 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7h15m\n\n46 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n7h15m\n\n46 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric.\n\nRead more about rapid charging of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric on the Fastned website.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

Average energy consumption and range based on moderate drive style and climate. Real-life values may differ significantly. Pricing information might not be actual for some regions. No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n38h30m\n\n9 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n24 hours\n\n15 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n12 hours\n\n29 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h15m\n\n42 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h15m\n\n42 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric.\n\nRead more about rapid charging of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric on the Fastned website.\n\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 150 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 33 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric \n \n\n 2 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n279 km\n\n2h 32min\n\n15 min\n\n133 km\n\n1h 12min\n\n249 km\n\n2h 16min\n\n15 min\n\n119 km\n\n1h 5min\n\n 368 km \n (3h 36min)\n \n\n225 km\n\n2h 3min\n\n15 min\n\n107 km\n\n58min\n\n 332 km \n (3h 16min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 412 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 368 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 332 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric (MY22), which was available to order from February 2021 until May 2022. \n The previous model had 15 km less range, same acceleration and was 5% less energy efficient.\n \n\n Preceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric \n(MY22)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n34h30m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n21h30m\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h45m\n\n31 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7h15m\n\n46 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n7h15m\n\n46 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric.\n\nRead more about rapid charging of the Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric on the Fastned website.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric \n \n\n 2 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n270 km\n\n2h 27min\n\n15 min\n\n138 km\n\n1h 15min\n\n237 km\n\n2h 9min\n\n15 min\n\n121 km\n\n1h 6min\n\n 358 km \n (3h 30min)\n \n\n212 km\n\n1h 55min\n\n15 min\n\n108 km\n\n59min\n\n 319 km \n (3h 9min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 408 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 358 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 319 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 250 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 30 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EX90 Twin Motor \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n413 km\n\n3h 45min\n\n15 min\n\n203 km\n\n1h 51min\n\n366 km\n\n3h 20min\n\n15 min\n\n180 km\n\n1h 38min\n\n 546 km \n (5h 13min)\n \n\n329 km\n\n2h 59min\n\n15 min\n\n161 km\n\n1h 28min\n\n 490 km \n (4h 42min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 616 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 546 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 490 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EX90 Twin Motor\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n40h30m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n25h15m\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n12h45m\n\n31 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h30m\n\n47 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h30m\n\n47 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 28 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n325 km\n\n2h 57min\n\n15 min\n\n169 km\n\n1h 32min\n\n287 km\n\n2h 36min\n\n15 min\n\n149 km\n\n1h 21min\n\n 436 km \n (4h 12min)\n \n\n257 km\n\n2h 20min\n\n15 min\n\n133 km\n\n1h 13min\n\n 390 km \n (3h 48min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 493 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 436 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 390 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Average energy consumption and range based on moderate drive style and climate. Real-life values may differ significantly. Pricing information might not be actual for some regions. No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n40h30m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n25h15m\n\n15 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n12h45m\n\n30 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h30m\n\n45 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h30m\n\n45 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%\nTime: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%\nRate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nAvg. \nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nCCS \n(50 kW DC)\n\n50 kW\n\n45 kW †\n\n78 min\n\n200 km/h\n\nCCS \n(100 kW DC)\n\n100 kW\n\n80 kW †\n\n44 min\n\n360 km/h\n\nCCS \n(150 kW DC)\n\n150 kW\n\n95 kW †\n\n37 min\n\n430 km/h\n\nCCS \n(175 kW DC)\n\n175 kW\n\n105 kW †\n\n33 min\n\n490 km/h\n\nCCS \n(350 kW DC)\n\n207 kW †\n\n110 kW †\n\n32 min\n\n500 km/h\n\n This vehicle supports Autocharge \n \n\n This vehicle does not support Plug & Charge \n \n\n† = Limited by charging capabilities of vehicle\nAutocharge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations.\nPlug & Charge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations in accordance with ISO 15118.\nActual charging rates may differ from data shown due to factors like outside temperature, state of the battery and driving style.\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nThe table below shows the claimed specifications from the manufacturer for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor. The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 28 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n310 km\n\n2h 49min\n\n15 min\n\n161 km\n\n1h 28min\n\n272 km\n\n2h 29min\n\n15 min\n\n142 km\n\n1h 17min\n\n 414 km \n (4h 1min)\n \n\n243 km\n\n2h 12min\n\n15 min\n\n126 km\n\n1h 9min\n\n 369 km \n (3h 36min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 472 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 414 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 369 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric (MY23), which was available to order from February 2022 until April 2023. \n The previous model had 35 km less range, same acceleration and was 4% less energy efficient.\n \n\n Preceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric \n(MY23)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n33h45m\n\n11 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n21 hours\n\n17 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h30m\n\n34 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7h15m\n\n49 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n7h15m\n\n49 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor.\n\nRead more about rapid charging of the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor on the Fastned website.\n\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor \n \n\n 2 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n288 km\n\n2h 37min\n\n15 min\n\n149 km\n\n1h 21min\n\n253 km\n\n2h 18min\n\n15 min\n\n131 km\n\n1h 11min\n\n 383 km \n (3h 44min)\n \n\n225 km\n\n2h 3min\n\n15 min\n\n116 km\n\n1h 3min\n\n 341 km \n (3h 21min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 437 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 383 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 341 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric (MY23), which was available to order from February 2022 until April 2023. \n The previous model had 20 km less range, same acceleration and was 8% less energy efficient.\n \n\n Preceding model Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric \n(MY23)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo C40 Recharge Single Motor\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER \n \n\n 3 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n342 km\n\n3h 6min\n\n15 min\n\n178 km\n\n1h 37min\n\n299 km\n\n2h 43min\n\n15 min\n\n155 km\n\n1h 25min\n\n 454 km \n (4h 23min)\n \n\n265 km\n\n2h 25min\n\n15 min\n\n138 km\n\n1h 15min\n\n 403 km \n (3h 55min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 520 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 454 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 403 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX30 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX30 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n25h15m\n\n11 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n15h45m\n\n17 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n8 hours\n\n34 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n5h15m\n\n52 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n5h15m\n\n52 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC.

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX30 Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX30 Single Motor ER.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 153 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 28 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EX30 Single Motor ER \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n302 km\n\n2h 44min\n\n15 min\n\n168 km\n\n1h 32min\n\n264 km\n\n2h 24min\n\n15 min\n\n147 km\n\n1h 20min\n\n 411 km \n (3h 59min)\n \n\n234 km\n\n2h 8min\n\n15 min\n\n131 km\n\n1h 11min\n\n 365 km \n (3h 34min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 470 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 411 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 365 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EX30 Single Motor ER\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nStandard 11.0 kW On-Board Charger\n\n \n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n33h15m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n20h45m\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h30m\n\n32 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7 hours\n\n49 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n7 hours\n\n49 km/h\n\nOptional 22.0kW On-Board Charger\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n33h15m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n20h45m\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h30m\n\n32 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7 hours\n\n49 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n3h30m\n\n97 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%\nTime: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%\nRate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nAvg. \nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nCCS \n(50 kW DC)\n\n50 kW\n\n50 kW\n\n57 min\n\n250 km/h\n\nCCS \n(150 kW DC)\n\n150 kW\n\n111 kW †\n\n26 min\n\n540 km/h\n\nCCS \n(300 kW DC)\n\n158 kW †\n\n113 kW †\n\n25 min\n\n570 km/h\n\n Charge Curve \n\nData made available by Fastned\n\n This vehicle does not support Autocharge \n \n\n This vehicle supports Plug & Charge \n \n\n† = Limited by charging capabilities of vehicle\nAutocharge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations.\nPlug & Charge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations in accordance with ISO 15118.\nActual charging rates may differ from data shown due to factors like outside temperature, state of the battery and driving style.\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nThe table below shows the claimed specifications from the manufacturer for charging the Volvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance. The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 153 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 28 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance \n \n\n 2 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n279 km\n\n2h 32min\n\n15 min\n\n155 km\n\n1h 25min\n\n246 km\n\n2h 14min\n\n15 min\n\n137 km\n\n1h 15min\n\n 384 km \n (3h 44min)\n \n\n221 km\n\n2h 0min\n\n15 min\n\n123 km\n\n1h 7min\n\n 344 km \n (3h 22min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 434 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 384 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 344 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX90 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX90 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n51h15m\n\n9 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n32 hours\n\n15 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n16 hours\n\n30 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n10h45m\n\n45 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n10h45m\n\n45 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX90 Single Motor.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 250 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 30 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EX90 Single Motor \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n396 km\n\n3h 36min\n\n15 min\n\n200 km\n\n1h 49min\n\n348 km\n\n3h 10min\n\n15 min\n\n175 km\n\n1h 36min\n\n 524 km \n (5h 1min)\n \n\n310 km\n\n2h 49min\n\n15 min\n\n156 km\n\n1h 25min\n\n 467 km \n (4h 29min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 596 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 524 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 467 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EX90 Single Motor\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n34h30m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n21h30m\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h45m\n\n32 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7h15m\n\n48 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n7h15m\n\n48 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 180 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 26 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EX40 Single Motor \n \n\n 2 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n279 km\n\n2h 32min\n\n15 min\n\n148 km\n\n1h 21min\n\n247 km\n\n2h 15min\n\n15 min\n\n131 km\n\n1h 11min\n\n 378 km \n (3h 41min)\n \n\n221 km\n\n2h 0min\n\n15 min\n\n117 km\n\n1h 4min\n\n 338 km \n (3h 19min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 427 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 378 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 338 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor (MY24), which was available to order from December 2022 until March 2024. \n The previous model had 5 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor \n(MY24)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EX40 Single Motor\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range.

This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same.

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n34h30m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n21h30m\n\n17 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h45m\n\n33 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7h15m\n\n50 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n7h15m\n\n50 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 180 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 26 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EC40 Single Motor \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n293 km\n\n2h 40min\n\n15 min\n\n155 km\n\n1h 25min\n\n257 km\n\n2h 20min\n\n15 min\n\n137 km\n\n1h 15min\n\n 394 km \n (3h 50min)\n \n\n229 km\n\n2h 5min\n\n15 min\n\n122 km\n\n1h 6min\n\n 351 km \n (3h 26min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 448 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 394 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 351 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor (MY24), which was available to order from December 2022 until March 2024. \n The previous model had 5 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor \n(MY24)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EC40 Single Motor\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n40h30m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n25h15m\n\n17 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n12h45m\n\n33 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h30m\n\n49 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h30m\n\n49 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%\nTime: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%\nRate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nAvg. \nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nCCS \n(50 kW DC)\n\n50 kW\n\n45 kW †\n\n78 min\n\n220 km/h\n\nCCS \n(100 kW DC)\n\n100 kW\n\n80 kW †\n\n44 min\n\n400 km/h\n\nCCS \n(150 kW DC)\n\n150 kW\n\n95 kW †\n\n37 min\n\n470 km/h\n\nCCS \n(175 kW DC)\n\n175 kW\n\n105 kW †\n\n33 min\n\n530 km/h\n\nCCS \n(350 kW DC)\n\n207 kW †\n\n110 kW †\n\n32 min\n\n550 km/h\n\n This vehicle supports Autocharge \n \n\n This vehicle does not support Plug & Charge \n \n\n† = Limited by charging capabilities of vehicle\nAutocharge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations.\nPlug & Charge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations in accordance with ISO 15118.\nActual charging rates may differ from data shown due to factors like outside temperature, state of the battery and driving style.\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nThe table below shows the claimed specifications from the manufacturer for charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER. The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 28 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER \n \n\n 3 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n342 km\n\n3h 6min\n\n15 min\n\n178 km\n\n1h 37min\n\n299 km\n\n2h 43min\n\n15 min\n\n155 km\n\n1h 25min\n\n 454 km \n (4h 23min)\n \n\n265 km\n\n2h 25min\n\n15 min\n\n138 km\n\n1h 15min\n\n 403 km \n (3h 55min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 520 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 454 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 403 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER (MY24), which was available to order from January 2022 until February 2024. \n The previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER \n(MY24)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EC40 Single Motor ER\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n40h30m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n25h15m\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n12h45m\n\n31 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h30m\n\n47 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h30m\n\n47 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n329 km\n\n3h 0min\n\n15 min\n\n171 km\n\n1h 33min\n\n288 km\n\n2h 37min\n\n15 min\n\n150 km\n\n1h 22min\n\n 438 km \n (4h 14min)\n \n\n257 km\n\n2h 20min\n\n15 min\n\n133 km\n\n1h 13min\n\n 390 km \n (3h 48min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 500 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 438 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 390 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n40h30m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n25h15m\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n12h45m\n\n31 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h30m\n\n47 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h30m\n\n47 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor.\n\nMax.

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX30 Cross Country. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX30 Cross Country can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n33h15m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n20h45m\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h30m\n\n32 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7 hours\n\n48 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n3h30m\n\n96 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX30 Cross Country.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 153 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 28 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EX30 Cross Country \n \n\n 2 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n270 km\n\n2h 27min\n\n15 min\n\n150 km\n\n1h 22min\n\n237 km\n\n2h 9min\n\n15 min\n\n132 km\n\n1h 12min\n\n 369 km \n (3h 36min)\n \n\n211 km\n\n1h 55min\n\n15 min\n\n118 km\n\n1h 4min\n\n 329 km \n (3h 14min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 420 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 369 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 329 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EX30 Cross Country\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo ES90 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo ES90 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n45 hours\n\n11 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n28 hours\n\n17 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n14 hours\n\n35 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n9h30m\n\n51 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n9h30m\n\n51 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo ES90 Single Motor.\n\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 310 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 22 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo ES90 Single Motor \n \n\n 4 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n410 km\n\n3h 44min\n\n15 min\n\n262 km\n\n2h 23min\n\n357 km\n\n3h 15min\n\n15 min\n\n228 km\n\n2h 4min\n\n 584 km \n (5h 34min)\n \n\n316 km\n\n2h 52min\n\n15 min\n\n201 km\n\n1h 50min\n\n 517 km \n (4h 57min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 672 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 584 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 517 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo ES90 Single Motor\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n34h30m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n21h30m\n\n17 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h45m\n\n33 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7h15m\n\n50 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n7h15m\n\n50 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%\nTime: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%\nRate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nAvg. \nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nCCS \n(50 kW DC)\n\n50 kW\n\n45 kW †\n\n66 min\n\n220 km/h\n\nCCS \n(100 kW DC)\n\n100 kW\n\n80 kW †\n\n37 min\n\n400 km/h\n\nCCS \n(150 kW DC)\n\n150 kW\n\n90 kW †\n\n33 min\n\n450 km/h\n\nCCS \n(175 kW DC)\n\n175 kW\n\n95 kW †\n\n31 min\n\n480 km/h\n\nCCS \n(350 kW DC)\n\n180 kW †\n\n100 kW †\n\n30 min\n\n500 km/h\n\n This vehicle supports Autocharge \n \n\n This vehicle supports Plug & Charge \n \n\n† = Limited by charging capabilities of vehicle\nAutocharge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations.\nPlug & Charge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations in accordance with ISO 15118.\nActual charging rates may differ from data shown due to factors like outside temperature, state of the battery and driving style.\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nThe table below shows the claimed specifications from the manufacturer for charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor. The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 180 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 26 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EC40 Single Motor \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n293 km\n\n2h 40min\n\n15 min\n\n155 km\n\n1h 25min\n\n257 km\n\n2h 20min\n\n15 min\n\n137 km\n\n1h 15min\n\n 394 km \n (3h 50min)\n \n\n229 km\n\n2h 5min\n\n15 min\n\n122 km\n\n1h 6min\n\n 351 km \n (3h 26min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 448 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 394 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 351 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EC40 Single Motor (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n The previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model Volvo EC40 Single Motor \n(MY25)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EC40 Single Motor\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n40h30m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n25h15m\n\n17 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n12h45m\n\n33 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h30m\n\n49 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h30m\n\n49 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 28 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER \n \n\n 3 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n342 km\n\n3h 6min\n\n15 min\n\n178 km\n\n1h 37min\n\n299 km\n\n2h 43min\n\n15 min\n\n155 km\n\n1h 25min\n\n 454 km \n (4h 23min)\n \n\n265 km\n\n2h 25min\n\n15 min\n\n138 km\n\n1h 15min\n\n 403 km \n (3h 55min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 520 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 454 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 403 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n The previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER \n(MY25)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EC40 Single Motor ER\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EC40 Twin Motor \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n329 km\n\n3h 0min\n\n15 min\n\n171 km\n\n1h 33min\n\n288 km\n\n2h 37min\n\n15 min\n\n150 km\n\n1h 22min\n\n 438 km \n (4h 14min)\n \n\n257 km\n\n2h 20min\n\n15 min\n\n133 km\n\n1h 13min\n\n 390 km \n (3h 48min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 500 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 438 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 390 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor (MY25), which was available to order from January 2022 until April 2025. \n The previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model Volvo EC40 Twin Motor \n(MY25)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EC40 Twin Motor\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n34h30m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n21h30m\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h45m\n\n32 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7h15m\n\n48 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n7h15m\n\n48 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC.

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n40h30m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n25h15m\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n12h45m\n\n31 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h30m\n\n47 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h30m\n\n47 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%\nTime: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%\nRate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nAvg. \nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nCCS \n(50 kW DC)\n\n50 kW\n\n45 kW †\n\n78 min\n\n210 km/h\n\nCCS \n(100 kW DC)\n\n100 kW\n\n80 kW †\n\n44 min\n\n380 km/h\n\nCCS \n(150 kW DC)\n\n150 kW\n\n95 kW †\n\n37 min\n\n450 km/h\n\nCCS \n(175 kW DC)\n\n175 kW\n\n105 kW †\n\n33 min\n\n500 km/h\n\nCCS \n(350 kW DC)\n\n207 kW †\n\n110 kW †\n\n32 min\n\n520 km/h\n\n This vehicle supports Autocharge \n \n\n This vehicle supports Plug & Charge \n \n\n† = Limited by charging capabilities of vehicle\nAutocharge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations.\nPlug & Charge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations in accordance with ISO 15118.\nActual charging rates may differ from data shown due to factors like outside temperature, state of the battery and driving style.\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nThe table below shows the claimed specifications from the manufacturer for charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER. The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 28 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n325 km\n\n2h 57min\n\n15 min\n\n169 km\n\n1h 32min\n\n287 km\n\n2h 36min\n\n15 min\n\n149 km\n\n1h 21min\n\n 436 km \n (4h 12min)\n \n\n257 km\n\n2h 20min\n\n15 min\n\n133 km\n\n1h 13min\n\n 390 km \n (3h 48min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 493 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 436 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 390 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n The previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER \n(MY25)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EX40 Single Motor ER\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n40h30m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n25h15m\n\n15 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n12h45m\n\n30 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h30m\n\n45 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h30m\n\n45 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 28 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EX40 Twin Motor \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n310 km\n\n2h 49min\n\n15 min\n\n161 km\n\n1h 28min\n\n272 km\n\n2h 29min\n\n15 min\n\n142 km\n\n1h 17min\n\n 414 km \n (4h 1min)\n \n\n243 km\n\n2h 12min\n\n15 min\n\n126 km\n\n1h 9min\n\n 369 km \n (3h 36min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 472 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 414 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 369 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor (MY25), which was available to order from January 2022 until April 2025. \n The previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model Volvo EX40 Twin Motor \n(MY25)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EX40 Twin Motor\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n40h30m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n25h15m\n\n15 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n12h45m\n\n30 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h30m\n\n45 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h30m\n\n45 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 28 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n310 km\n\n2h 49min\n\n15 min\n\n161 km\n\n1h 28min\n\n272 km\n\n2h 29min\n\n15 min\n\n142 km\n\n1h 17min\n\n 414 km \n (4h 1min)\n \n\n243 km\n\n2h 12min\n\n15 min\n\n126 km\n\n1h 9min\n\n 369 km \n (3h 36min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 472 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 414 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 369 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n The previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance \n(MY25)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n52h15m\n\n9 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n32h30m\n\n15 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n16h15m\n\n30 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n11 hours\n\n44 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n11 hours\n\n44 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC.

Average energy consumption and range based on moderate drive style and climate. Real-life values may differ significantly. Pricing information might not be actual for some regions. No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n52h15m\n\n9 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n32h30m\n\n14 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n16h15m\n\n29 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n11 hours\n\n42 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n11 hours\n\n42 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%\nTime: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%\nRate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nAvg. \nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nCCS \n(50 kW DC)\n\n50 kW\n\n50 kW\n\n90 min\n\n210 km/h\n\nCCS \n(100 kW DC)\n\n100 kW\n\n90 kW †\n\n50 min\n\n390 km/h\n\nCCS \n(150 kW DC)\n\n150 kW\n\n120 kW †\n\n38 min\n\n510 km/h\n\nCCS \n(175 kW DC)\n\n175 kW\n\n135 kW †\n\n33 min\n\n590 km/h\n\nCCS \n(350 kW DC)\n\n350 kW\n\n200 kW †\n\n23 min\n\n840 km/h\n\n This vehicle supports Autocharge \n \n\n This vehicle supports Plug & Charge \n \n\n† = Limited by charging capabilities of vehicle\nAutocharge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations.\nPlug & Charge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations in accordance with ISO 15118.\nActual charging rates may differ from data shown due to factors like outside temperature, state of the battery and driving style.\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nThe table below shows the claimed specifications from the manufacturer for charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance. The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 350 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 22 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n378 km\n\n3h 26min\n\n15 min\n\n238 km\n\n2h 10min\n\n336 km\n\n3h 3min\n\n15 min\n\n211 km\n\n1h 55min\n\n 547 km \n (5h 13min)\n \n\n302 km\n\n2h 45min\n\n15 min\n\n190 km\n\n1h 44min\n\n 492 km \n (4h 44min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 616 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 547 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 492 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance (MY24-25), which was available to order from December 2022 until November 2025. \n The previous model had 20 km more range, 17% slower acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance \n(MY24-25)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX60 P6. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX60 P6 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41 hours\n\n11 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n25h30m\n\n18 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n12h45m\n\n36 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n52 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n4h15m\n\n100 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX60 P6.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%\nTime: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%\nRate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nAvg. \nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nCCS \n(50 kW DC)\n\n50 kW\n\n50 kW\n\n71 min\n\n260 km/h\n\nCCS \n(100 kW DC)\n\n100 kW\n\n90 kW †\n\n39 min\n\n490 km/h\n\nCCS \n(150 kW DC)\n\n150 kW\n\n120 kW †\n\n29 min\n\n650 km/h\n\nCCS \n(175 kW DC)\n\n175 kW\n\n135 kW †\n\n26 min\n\n730 km/h\n\nCCS \n(350 kW DC)\n\n320 kW †\n\n190 kW †\n\n19 min\n\n1000 km/h\n\n This vehicle supports Autocharge \n \n\n This vehicle supports Plug & Charge \n \n\n† = Limited by charging capabilities of vehicle\nAutocharge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations.\nPlug & Charge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations in accordance with ISO 15118.\nActual charging rates may differ from data shown due to factors like outside temperature, state of the battery and driving style.\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nThe table below shows the claimed specifications from the manufacturer for charging the Volvo EX60 P6. The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nVolvo Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 320 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 18 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EX60 P6 \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n379 km\n\n3h 27min\n\n15 min\n\n265 km\n\n2h 25min\n\n330 km\n\n3h 0min\n\n15 min\n\n231 km\n\n2h 6min\n\n 562 km \n (5h 21min)\n \n\n293 km\n\n2h 40min\n\n15 min\n\n205 km\n\n1h 52min\n\n 498 km \n (4h 47min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 644 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 562 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 498 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EX60 P6\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n Volvo EX60 P10 AWD \n \n\n 4 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n418 km\n\n3h 48min\n\n15 min\n\n293 km\n\n2h 40min\n\n365 km\n\n3h 19min\n\n15 min\n\n256 km\n\n2h 19min\n\n 620 km \n (5h 53min)\n \n\n324 km\n\n2h 57min\n\n15 min\n\n227 km\n\n2h 4min\n\n 551 km \n (5h 16min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 711 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 620 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 551 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nVolvo EX60 P10 AWD\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX60 Cross Country P10 AWD. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX60 Cross Country P10 AWD can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n46h45m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n29 hours\n\n17 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n14h30m\n\n34 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n9h45m\n\n50 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n5 hours\n\n98 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX60 Cross Country P10 AWD.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions.
