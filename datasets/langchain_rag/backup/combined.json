Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i3 60 Ah. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i3 60 Ah can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i3 60 Ah.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i3 60 Ah        \n    \n\n            0 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n95 km\n52min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n59 km\n32min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n82 km\n45min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n51 km\n28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                133 km \n                (1h 28min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n72 km\n39min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n45 km\n24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                117 km \n                (1h 18min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    153 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    133 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    117 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i3 60 Ah\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i3 94 Ah. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i3 94 Ah.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i3 94 Ah        \n    \n\n            0 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n135 km\n1h 14min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n61 km\n33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n117 km\n1h 4min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n53 km\n29min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                170 km \n                (1h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n103 km\n56min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n47 km\n25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                150 km \n                (1h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    196 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    170 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    150 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i3 60 Ah, which was available to order from September 2013 until February 2017. \n\t\tThe previous model had 50 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i3 60 Ah\t\n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i3 94 Ah\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i3 94 Ah. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i3 94 Ah can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i3 94 Ah.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%Time: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%Rate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\n\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2) *\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i3 94 Ah        \n    \n\n            0 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n135 km\n1h 14min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n61 km\n33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n117 km\n1h 4min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n53 km\n29min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                170 km \n                (1h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n103 km\n56min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n47 km\n25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                150 km \n                (1h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    196 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    170 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    150 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i3 94 Ah, which was available to order from July 2016 until August 2017. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i3 94 Ah\t\n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i3 94 Ah\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i3s 94 Ah. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i3s 94 Ah can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Check local specifications for details.\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i3s 94 Ah.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i3s 94 Ah        \n    \n\n            0 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n130 km\n1h 11min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n59 km\n32min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n113 km\n1h 1min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n51 km\n28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                163 km \n                (1h 44min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n99 km\n54min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n45 km\n24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                144 km \n                (1h 33min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    189 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    163 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    144 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i3s 94 Ah\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX3. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX3 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX3.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX3        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n316 km\n2h 52min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n151 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n278 km\n2h 31min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                411 km \n                (3h 59min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n248 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n119 km\n1h 5min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                366 km \n                (3h 35min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    467 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    411 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    366 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX3\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i3 120 Ah. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i3 120 Ah can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i3 120 Ah.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i3 120 Ah        \n    \n\n            1 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n194 km\n1h 46min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n63 km\n34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n168 km\n1h 32min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n54 km\n30min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                222 km \n                (2h 17min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n148 km\n1h 21min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n48 km\n26min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                196 km \n                (2h 2min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    257 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    222 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    196 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i3 94 Ah, which was available to order from October 2017 until October 2018. \n\t\tThe previous model had 70 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i3 94 Ah\t\n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i3 120 Ah\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i3s 120 Ah. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i3s 120 Ah can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i3s 120 Ah.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i3s 120 Ah        \n    \n\n            1 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n184 km\n1h 41min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n60 km\n33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n162 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n52 km\n29min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                214 km \n                (2h 12min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n144 km\n1h 19min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n47 km\n25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                191 km \n                (1h 59min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    244 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    214 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    191 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i3s 94 Ah, which was available to order from October 2017 until October 2018. \n\t\tThe previous model had 70 km less range, same acceleration and was 3% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i3s 94 Ah\t\n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i3s 120 Ah\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 eDrive40. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 eDrive40 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 eDrive40.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i4 eDrive40        \n    \n\n            4 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n438 km\n3h 59min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n238 km\n2h 10min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n378 km\n3h 26min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n206 km\n1h 52min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                584 km \n                (5h 33min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n333 km\n3h 2min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n181 km\n1h 39min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                514 km \n                (4h 56min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    675 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    584 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    514 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i4 eDrive40\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX xDrive40 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX xDrive40.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX xDrive40        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n297 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n144 km\n1h 18min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n262 km\n2h 23min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n127 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                388 km \n                (3h 47min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n234 km\n2h 8min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n113 km\n1h 2min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                347 km \n                (3h 25min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    441 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    388 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    347 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX xDrive40\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX xDrive50. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX xDrive50 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX xDrive50.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX xDrive50        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n419 km\n3h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n191 km\n1h 44min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n368 km\n3h 21min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n168 km\n1h 32min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                537 km \n                (5h 8min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n329 km\n2h 59min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                479 km \n                (4h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    610 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    537 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    479 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX xDrive50\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 M50. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 M50 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 M50.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i4 M50        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n378 km\n3h 26min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n206 km\n1h 52min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n330 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n180 km\n1h 38min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                510 km \n                (4h 53min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n159 km\n1h 27min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                452 km \n                (4h 22min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    584 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    510 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    452 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i4 M50\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX3. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX3 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX3.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX3        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n316 km\n2h 52min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n151 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n278 km\n2h 31min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                411 km \n                (3h 59min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n248 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n119 km\n1h 5min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                366 km \n                (3h 35min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    467 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    411 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    366 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX3 (MY21), which was available to order from November 2020 until September 2021. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW iX3 (MY21) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX3\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX M60. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX M60.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX M60        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n401 km\n3h 39min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n183 km\n1h 40min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n353 km\n3h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                514 km \n                (4h 55min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n315 km\n2h 52min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n144 km\n1h 18min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                458 km \n                (4h 25min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    584 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    514 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    458 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX M60\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i7 xDrive60. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i7 xDrive60 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i7 xDrive60.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i7 xDrive60        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n432 km\n3h 55min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n211 km\n1h 55min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n379 km\n3h 27min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n185 km\n1h 41min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                564 km \n                (5h 23min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n338 km\n3h 4min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n165 km\n1h 30min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                503 km \n                (4h 49min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    643 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    564 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    503 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i7 xDrive60\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX1 xDrive30. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Check local specifications for details.\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX1 xDrive30.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX1 xDrive30        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n320 km\n2h 55min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n153 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n276 km\n2h 31min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n132 km\n1h 12min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                408 km \n                (3h 58min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 km\n2h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n116 km\n1h 3min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                359 km \n                (3h 30min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    473 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    408 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    359 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX1 xDrive30\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 eDrive35. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 eDrive35 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 eDrive35.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i4 eDrive35        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n370 km\n3h 22min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n196 km\n1h 47min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n318 km\n2h 54min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n169 km\n1h 32min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                487 km \n                (4h 41min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n279 km\n2h 32min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n148 km\n1h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                427 km \n                (4h 8min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    566 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    487 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    427 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i4 eDrive35\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i7 M70 xDrive. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i7 M70 xDrive can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i7 M70 xDrive.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i7 M70 xDrive        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n409 km\n3h 43min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n200 km\n1h 49min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n359 km\n3h 16min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n175 km\n1h 36min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                534 km \n                (5h 7min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n320 km\n2h 55min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n156 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                476 km \n                (4h 35min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    608 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    534 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    476 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i7 M70 xDrive\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i7 eDrive50. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i7 eDrive50 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i7 eDrive50.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i7 eDrive50        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n440 km\n4h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n215 km\n1h 57min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n385 km\n3h 30min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n188 km\n1h 42min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                572 km \n                (5h 27min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n342 km\n3h 6min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n167 km\n1h 31min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                508 km \n                (4h 52min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    655 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    572 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    508 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i7 eDrive50\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n395 km\n3h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n219 km\n1h 59min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n345 km\n3h 8min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n191 km\n1h 44min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                536 km \n                (5h 7min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n306 km\n2h 47min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n169 km\n1h 32min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                475 km \n                (4h 34min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    614 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    536 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    475 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n351 km\n3h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n195 km\n1h 46min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n308 km\n2h 48min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n171 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                479 km \n                (4h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n275 km\n2h 30min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n152 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                427 km \n                (4h 8min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    546 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    479 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    427 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX1 eDrive20. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX1 eDrive20 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX1 eDrive20.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX1 eDrive20        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n324 km\n2h 56min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n283 km\n2h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n135 km\n1h 14min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                419 km \n                (4h 4min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n252 km\n2h 17min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n120 km\n1h 6min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                372 km \n                (3h 38min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    478 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    419 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    372 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX1 eDrive20\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX2 xDrive30. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX2 xDrive30.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX2 xDrive30        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n324 km\n2h 56min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n281 km\n2h 33min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n134 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                415 km \n                (4h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n248 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n118 km\n1h 5min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                366 km \n                (3h 35min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    478 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    415 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    366 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX2 xDrive30\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n387 km\n3h 31min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n214 km\n1h 57min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n336 km\n3h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n186 km\n1h 42min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                522 km \n                (5h 0min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n297 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n165 km\n1h 30min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                462 km \n                (4h 27min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    601 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    522 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    462 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX2 eDrive20. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX2 eDrive20 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX2 eDrive20.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX2 eDrive20        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n333 km\n3h 1min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n159 km\n1h 27min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n290 km\n2h 38min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n138 km\n1h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                428 km \n                (4h 8min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n123 km\n1h 7min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                379 km \n                (3h 42min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    492 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    428 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    379 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX2 eDrive20\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n387 km\n3h 31min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n214 km\n1h 57min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n336 km\n3h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n186 km\n1h 42min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                522 km \n                (5h 0min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n297 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n165 km\n1h 30min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                462 km \n                (4h 27min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    601 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    522 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    462 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i5 eDrive40 Touring\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n351 km\n3h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n195 km\n1h 46min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n308 km\n2h 48min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n171 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                479 km \n                (4h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n275 km\n2h 30min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n152 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                427 km \n                (4h 8min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    546 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    479 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    427 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 eDrive35. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 eDrive35 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 eDrive35.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i4 eDrive35        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n368 km\n3h 21min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n195 km\n1h 46min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n318 km\n2h 53min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n168 km\n1h 32min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                486 km \n                (4h 40min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n280 km\n2h 33min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n148 km\n1h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                428 km \n                (4h 9min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    563 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    486 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    428 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i4 eDrive35, which was available to order from November 2022 until May 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i4 eDrive35\t\n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i4 eDrive35\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 eDrive40. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 eDrive40 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i4 eDrive40        \n    \n\n            4 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n441 km\n4h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n236 km\n2h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n382 km\n3h 28min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n205 km\n1h 52min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                587 km \n                (5h 35min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n337 km\n3h 4min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n181 km\n1h 39min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                518 km \n                (4h 58min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    677 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    587 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    518 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i4 eDrive40, which was available to order from November 2021 until May 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i4 eDrive40\t\n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i4 eDrive40\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 xDrive40.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i4 xDrive40        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n418 km\n3h 48min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n224 km\n2h 2min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362 km\n3h 18min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n194 km\n1h 46min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                556 km \n                (5h 19min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n320 km\n2h 54min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n171 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                491 km \n                (4h 42min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    642 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    556 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    491 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i4 xDrive40\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 M50. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 M50 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 M50.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i4 M50        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n383 km\n3h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n205 km\n1h 52min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n335 km\n3h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n179 km\n1h 38min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                514 km \n                (4h 56min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n297 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n159 km\n1h 27min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                457 km \n                (4h 24min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    588 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    514 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    457 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i4 M50, which was available to order from November 2021 until May 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i4 M50\t\n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i4 M50\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n369 km\n3h 21min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n204 km\n1h 51min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n323 km\n2h 56min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n179 km\n1h 38min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                502 km \n                (4h 49min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n288 km\n2h 37min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n159 km\n1h 27min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                447 km \n                (4h 19min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    574 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    502 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    447 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i5 xDrive40 Touring\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX xDrive45. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX xDrive45 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX xDrive45.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX xDrive45        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n391 km\n3h 33min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n167 km\n1h 31min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n343 km\n3h 7min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n147 km\n1h 20min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                490 km \n                (4h 42min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n306 km\n2h 47min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n131 km\n1h 11min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                436 km \n                (4h 13min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    559 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    490 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    436 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX xDrive40, which was available to order from October 2021 until January 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 110 km less range, 20% slower acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW iX xDrive40\t\n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX xDrive45\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX xDrive60. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX xDrive60 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX xDrive60.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX xDrive60        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n436 km\n3h 58min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n194 km\n1h 46min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n384 km\n3h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n170 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                554 km \n                (5h 17min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n342 km\n3h 7min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n152 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                494 km \n                (4h 45min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    630 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    554 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    494 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX xDrive50, which was available to order from November 2021 until January 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 20 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW iX xDrive50\t\n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX xDrive60\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX M70 xDrive. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX M70 xDrive can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX M70 xDrive.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX M70 xDrive        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n414 km\n3h 46min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n184 km\n1h 40min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n363 km\n3h 18min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                524 km \n                (5h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n323 km\n2h 56min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n144 km\n1h 18min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                467 km \n                (4h 29min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    597 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    524 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    467 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX M60, which was available to order from April 2022 until January 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 15 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW iX M60\t\n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX M70 xDrive\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n406 km\n3h 41min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n225 km\n2h 3min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n352 km\n3h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n195 km\n1h 46min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                547 km \n                (5h 13min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n311 km\n2h 50min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n172 km\n1h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                483 km \n                (4h 39min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    631 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    547 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    483 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan (MY23-24), which was available to order from May 2023 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan (MY23-24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n395 km\n3h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n219 km\n1h 59min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n345 km\n3h 8min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n191 km\n1h 44min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                536 km \n                (5h 7min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n306 km\n2h 47min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n169 km\n1h 32min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                475 km \n                (4h 34min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    614 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    536 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    475 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan (MY24), which was available to order from January 2022 until February 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n360 km\n3h 16min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n199 km\n1h 49min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n314 km\n2h 51min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n174 km\n1h 35min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                488 km \n                (4h 41min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n279 km\n2h 32min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n154 km\n1h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                433 km \n                (4h 11min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    559 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    488 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    433 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan (MY23-24), which was available to order from May 2023 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan (MY23-24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n391 km\n3h 33min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n216 km\n1h 58min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n341 km\n3h 6min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n189 km\n1h 43min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                529 km \n                (5h 4min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n302 km\n2h 45min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n167 km\n1h 31min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                469 km \n                (4h 31min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    607 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    529 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    469 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring (MY24), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i5 eDrive40 Touring\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n379 km\n3h 27min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n210 km\n1h 54min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n330 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n183 km\n1h 40min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                513 km \n                (4h 55min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n292 km\n2h 39min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n162 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                454 km \n                (4h 22min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    588 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    513 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    454 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring (MY24), which was available to order from January 2022 until February 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was 3% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i5 xDrive40 Touring\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n355 km\n3h 14min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n196 km\n1h 47min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n312 km\n2h 50min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n173 km\n1h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                485 km \n                (4h 39min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n279 km\n2h 32min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n154 km\n1h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                433 km \n                (4h 11min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    551 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    485 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    433 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring (MY24), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was 3% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 eDrive35. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 eDrive35 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 eDrive35.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i4 eDrive35        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n373 km\n3h 23min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n197 km\n1h 48min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n322 km\n2h 56min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n170 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                493 km \n                (4h 44min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n284 km\n2h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                434 km \n                (4h 12min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    570 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    493 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    434 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i4 eDrive35, which was available to order from June 2024 until July 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 5 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i4 eDrive35\t\n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i4 eDrive35\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 eDrive40. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 eDrive40 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 eDrive40.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i4 eDrive40        \n    \n\n            4 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n446 km\n4h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n239 km\n2h 10min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n387 km\n3h 31min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n207 km\n1h 53min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                595 km \n                (5h 39min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n342 km\n3h 6min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n183 km\n1h 40min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                525 km \n                (5h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    685 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    595 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    525 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i4 eDrive40, which was available to order from June 2024 until July 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i4 eDrive40\t\n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i4 eDrive40\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 xDrive40. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 xDrive40.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i4 xDrive40        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n423 km\n3h 51min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n227 km\n2h 4min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n367 km\n3h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n197 km\n1h 47min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                563 km \n                (5h 22min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n324 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n173 km\n1h 35min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                497 km \n                (4h 47min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    650 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    563 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    497 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i4 xDrive40, which was available to order from January 2022 until July 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 5 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i4 xDrive40\t\n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i4 xDrive40\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 M60 xDrive. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 M60 xDrive can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 M60 xDrive.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW i4 M60 xDrive        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n391 km\n3h 33min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n210 km\n1h 54min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n340 km\n3h 6min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n182 km\n1h 39min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                523 km \n                (5h 0min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n301 km\n2h 44min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                462 km \n                (4h 27min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    601 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    523 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    462 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i4 M50, which was available to order from June 2024 until July 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 15 km less range, 5% slower acceleration and was 3% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW i4 M50\t\n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW i4 M60 xDrive\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX3 50 xDrive. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX3 50 xDrive can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX3 50 xDrive.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX3 50 xDrive        \n    \n\n            5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n512 km\n4h 39min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n338 km\n3h 5min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n447 km\n4h 4min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n295 km\n2h 41min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                742 km \n                (7h 0min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n396 km\n3h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n262 km\n2h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                658 km \n                (6h 14min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    850 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    742 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    658 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX3 (MY22-24), which was available to order from September 2021 until October 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had 225 km less range, 39% slower acceleration and was 8% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW iX3 (MY22-24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX3 50 xDrive\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX1 eDrive20. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX1 eDrive20 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX1 eDrive20.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX1 eDrive20        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n333 km\n3h 2min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n160 km\n1h 27min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n290 km\n2h 38min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n139 km\n1h 16min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                429 km \n                (4h 9min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n256 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n123 km\n1h 7min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                379 km \n                (3h 42min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    493 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    429 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    379 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX1 eDrive20 (MY23-25), which was available to order from September 2023 until February 2026. \n\t\tThe previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW iX1 eDrive20 (MY23-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX1 eDrive20\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX1 xDrive30. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX1 xDrive30 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX1 xDrive30.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX1 xDrive30        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n324 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n156 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n283 km\n2h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n136 km\n1h 14min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                419 km \n                (4h 4min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n252 km\n2h 17min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n121 km\n1h 6min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                373 km \n                (3h 38min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    480 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    419 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    373 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX1 xDrive30 (MY23-25), which was available to order from November 2022 until February 2026. \n\t\tThe previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW iX1 xDrive30 (MY23-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX1 xDrive30\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX2 eDrive20. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX2 eDrive20 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX2 eDrive20.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX2 eDrive20        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n341 km\n3h 6min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n164 km\n1h 29min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n296 km\n2h 41min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n142 km\n1h 17min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                437 km \n                (4h 13min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n261 km\n2h 22min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n125 km\n1h 8min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                386 km \n                (3h 45min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    505 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    437 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    386 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX2 eDrive20 (MY23-25), which was available to order from January 2024 until February 2026. \n\t\tThe previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW iX2 eDrive20 (MY23-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX2 eDrive20\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX2 xDrive30. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX2 xDrive30 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX2 xDrive30.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    BMW iX2 xDrive30        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n333 km\n3h 2min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n160 km\n1h 27min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n290 km\n2h 38min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n139 km\n1h 16min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                429 km \n                (4h 9min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n256 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n123 km\n1h 7min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                379 km \n                (3h 42min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    493 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    429 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    379 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX2 xDrive30 (MY23-25), which was available to order from October 2023 until February 2026. \n\t\tThe previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model BMW iX2 xDrive30 (MY23-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBMW iX2 xDrive30\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2.\nRead more about rapid charging of the Polestar 2 on the Fastned website.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n325 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n154 km\n1h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n284 km\n2h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n135 km\n1h 14min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                419 km \n                (4h 4min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n252 km\n2h 17min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n120 km\n1h 5min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                372 km \n                (3h 37min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    479 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    419 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    372 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n287 km\n2h 37min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n125 km\n1h 8min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n250 km\n2h 16min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n108 km\n59min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                358 km \n                (3h 30min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n220 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n96 km\n52min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                316 km \n                (3h 7min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    412 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    358 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    316 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n352 km\n3h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n167 km\n1h 31min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n305 km\n2h 47min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n145 km\n1h 19min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                451 km \n                (4h 21min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n270 km\n2h 27min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n128 km\n1h 10min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                398 km \n                (3h 52min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    519 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    451 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    398 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n325 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n154 km\n1h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n284 km\n2h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n135 km\n1h 14min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                419 km \n                (4h 4min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n252 km\n2h 17min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n120 km\n1h 5min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                372 km \n                (3h 37min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    479 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    419 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    372 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 (MY20), which was available to order from August 2020 until May 2021. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 (MY20) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n311 km\n2h 50min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n273 km\n2h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n141 km\n1h 17min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                414 km \n                (4h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 km\n2h 13min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                369 km \n                (3h 37min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    472 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    414 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    369 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY21), which was available to order from September 2021 until March 2022. \n\t\tThe previous model had 30 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY21) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 3 Long Range Dual motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 3 Long Range Dual motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 3 Long Range Dual motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n422 km\n3h 50min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n207 km\n1h 53min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n373 km\n3h 23min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n183 km\n1h 40min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                555 km \n                (5h 18min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n333 km\n3h 2min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n163 km\n1h 29min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                497 km \n                (4h 46min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    630 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    555 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    497 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 3 Long Range Dual motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 3 Long Range Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 3 Long Range Performance        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n391 km\n3h 34min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n192 km\n1h 45min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n346 km\n3h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n170 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                516 km \n                (4h 57min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n311 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n152 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                463 km \n                (4h 27min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    583 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    516 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    463 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 3 Long Range Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance.\nRead more about rapid charging of the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance on the Fastned website.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Performance        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n315 km\n2h 52min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n277 km\n2h 31min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n132 km\n1h 12min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                409 km \n                (3h 58min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n247 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n118 km\n1h 4min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                365 km \n                (3h 34min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    466 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    409 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    365 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor.\nRead more about rapid charging of the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor on the Fastned website.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n334 km\n3h 2min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n172 km\n1h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n290 km\n2h 38min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                439 km \n                (4h 15min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n256 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n132 km\n1h 12min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                388 km \n                (3h 47min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    506 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    439 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    388 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY22-23), which was available to order from March 2022 until October 2022. \n\t\tThe previous model had 20 km less range, 16% slower acceleration and was 5% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY22-23) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n395 km\n3h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n205 km\n1h 52min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n345 km\n3h 8min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n179 km\n1h 38min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                525 km \n                (5h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n306 km\n2h 47min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n159 km\n1h 27min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                466 km \n                (4h 29min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    600 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    525 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    466 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor (MY21-22), which was available to order from September 2021 until January 2023. \n\t\tThe previous model had 50 km less range, 19% slower acceleration and was 7% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor (MY21-22) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n378 km\n3h 26min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n197 km\n1h 47min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n330 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n172 km\n1h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                501 km \n                (4h 49min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n152 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                445 km \n                (4h 18min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    575 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    501 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    445 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor (MY21-23), which was available to order from September 2021 until January 2023. \n\t\tThe previous model had 60 km less range, 4% slower acceleration and was 9% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor (MY21-23) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Performance        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n378 km\n3h 26min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n197 km\n1h 47min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n330 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n172 km\n1h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                501 km \n                (4h 49min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n152 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                445 km \n                (4h 18min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    575 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    501 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    445 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance (MY23), which was available to order from August 2022 until January 2023. \n\t\tThe previous model had 65 km less range, 5% slower acceleration and was 11% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Performance (MY23) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 4 Long Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 4 Long Range Single Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 4 Long Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n409 km\n3h 43min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n199 km\n1h 48min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n358 km\n3h 16min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n174 km\n1h 35min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                533 km \n                (5h 6min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n319 km\n2h 54min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                474 km \n                (4h 34min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    607 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    533 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    474 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 4 Long Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 4 Long Range Dual Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 4 Long Range Dual Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n401 km\n3h 39min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n195 km\n1h 46min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n353 km\n3h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n171 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                524 km \n                (5h 0min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n314 km\n2h 52min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n153 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                467 km \n                (4h 30min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    596 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    524 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    467 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 4 Long Range Dual Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n343 km\n3h 7min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n182 km\n1h 39min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n296 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n157 km\n1h 26min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                454 km \n                (4h 23min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n261 km\n2h 22min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n139 km\n1h 16min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                400 km \n                (3h 53min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    525 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    454 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    400 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY24), which was available to order from January 2023 until September 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n399 km\n3h 38min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n208 km\n1h 53min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n347 km\n3h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n180 km\n1h 38min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                527 km \n                (5h 2min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n306 km\n2h 47min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n159 km\n1h 27min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                466 km \n                (4h 29min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    607 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    527 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    466 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor (MY24), which was available to order from January 2023 until September 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had 5 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n382 km\n3h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n199 km\n1h 48min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n335 km\n3h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n174 km\n1h 35min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                509 km \n                (4h 53min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n297 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                452 km \n                (4h 21min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    581 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    509 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    452 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor (MY24), which was available to order from January 2023 until September 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had 5 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Performance        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n378 km\n3h 26min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n197 km\n1h 47min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n330 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n172 km\n1h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                501 km \n                (4h 49min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n152 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                445 km \n                (4h 18min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    575 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    501 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    445 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance (MY24), which was available to order from January 2023 until September 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Performance (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 3 Long Range Single motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 3 Long Range Single motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 3 Long Range Single motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 3 Long Range Single motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n436 km\n3h 58min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n214 km\n1h 57min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n383 km\n3h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n188 km\n1h 42min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                571 km \n                (5h 26min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n341 km\n3h 6min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n168 km\n1h 31min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                509 km \n                (4h 52min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    650 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    571 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    509 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 3 Long Range Single motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n343 km\n3h 7min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n182 km\n1h 39min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n296 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n157 km\n1h 26min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                454 km \n                (4h 23min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n261 km\n2h 22min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n139 km\n1h 16min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                400 km \n                (3h 53min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    525 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    454 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    400 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY25), which was available to order from June 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n399 km\n3h 38min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n208 km\n1h 53min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n347 km\n3h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n180 km\n1h 38min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                527 km \n                (5h 2min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n306 km\n2h 47min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n159 km\n1h 27min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                466 km \n                (4h 29min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    607 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    527 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    466 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor (MY25), which was available to order from June 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n382 km\n3h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n199 km\n1h 48min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n335 km\n3h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n174 km\n1h 35min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                509 km \n                (4h 53min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n297 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                452 km \n                (4h 21min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    581 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    509 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    452 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor (MY25), which was available to order from June 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Performance        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n378 km\n3h 26min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n197 km\n1h 47min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n330 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n172 km\n1h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                501 km \n                (4h 49min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n152 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                445 km \n                (4h 18min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    575 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    501 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    445 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance (MY25), which was available to order from June 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Performance (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 5 Dual Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 5 Dual Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 5 Dual Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 5 Dual Motor        \n    \n\n            4.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n492 km\n4h 28min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n311 km\n2h 50min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n428 km\n3h 53min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n270 km\n2h 27min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                698 km \n                (6h 35min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n379 km\n3h 26min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n239 km\n2h 11min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                618 km \n                (5h 52min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    803 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    698 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    618 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 5 Dual Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 5 Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 5 Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 5 Performance.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 5 Performance        \n    \n\n            4 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n446 km\n4h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n282 km\n2h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n390 km\n3h 33min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n247 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                637 km \n                (6h 3min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n347 km\n3h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n219 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                566 km \n                (5h 24min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    728 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    637 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    566 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 5 Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 3 Rear Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 3 Rear Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 3 Rear Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 3 Rear Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n360 km\n3h 16min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n230 km\n2h 5min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n317 km\n2h 53min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n203 km\n1h 50min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                520 km \n                (4h 58min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n284 km\n2h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n181 km\n1h 39min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                465 km \n                (4h 29min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    590 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    520 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    465 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 3 Long Range Single motor (MY23-25), which was available to order from June 2024 until October 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 90 km more range, 20% slower acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 3 Long Range Single motor (MY23-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 3 Rear Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 3 Dual Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 3 Dual Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 3 Dual Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 3 Dual Motor        \n    \n\n            4 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n410 km\n3h 44min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n258 km\n2h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362 km\n3h 18min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n228 km\n2h 4min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                590 km \n                (5h 37min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n324 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n204 km\n1h 51min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                529 km \n                (5h 3min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    668 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    590 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    529 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 3 Long Range Dual motor (MY23-25), which was available to order from November 2022 until October 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 15 km more range, 6% slower acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 3 Long Range Dual motor (MY23-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 3 Dual Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 3 Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 3 Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 3 Performance.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 3 Performance        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n373 km\n3h 24min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n235 km\n2h 8min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n331 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n208 km\n1h 54min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                539 km \n                (5h 9min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n297 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n187 km\n1h 42min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                484 km \n                (4h 39min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    608 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    539 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    484 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 3 Long Range Performance (MY23-25), which was available to order from November 2022 until October 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 20 km more range, 21% slower acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 3 Long Range Performance (MY23-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 3 Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n266 km\n2h 25min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n236 km\n2h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n112 km\n1h 1min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                348 km \n                (3h 25min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n212 km\n1h 55min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n101 km\n55min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                312 km \n                (3h 5min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    392 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    348 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    312 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric.\nRead more about rapid charging of the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric on the Fastned website.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n292 km\n2h 39min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n139 km\n1h 16min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n122 km\n1h 7min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                379 km \n                (3h 42min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n230 km\n2h 5min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n109 km\n1h 0min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                339 km \n                (3h 20min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    431 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    379 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    339 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n266 km\n2h 25min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n236 km\n2h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n112 km\n1h 1min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                348 km \n                (3h 25min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n212 km\n1h 55min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n101 km\n55min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                312 km \n                (3h 5min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    392 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    348 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    312 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge (MY21), which was available to order from February 2020 until May 2021. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge (MY21) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 km\n2h 13min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n124 km\n1h 7min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n215 km\n1h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n110 km\n1h 0min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                325 km \n                (3h 12min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n193 km\n1h 45min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n98 km\n54min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                292 km \n                (2h 54min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    367 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    325 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    292 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n266 km\n2h 25min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n135 km\n1h 14min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n236 km\n2h 8min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n120 km\n1h 5min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                355 km \n                (3h 28min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n212 km\n1h 55min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n108 km\n59min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                319 km \n                (3h 9min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    401 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    355 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    319 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric (MY22), which was available to order from February 2021 until May 2022. \n\t\tThe previous model had 25 km less range, same acceleration and was 8% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric (MY22) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n279 km\n2h 32min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 12min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n249 km\n2h 16min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n119 km\n1h 5min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                368 km \n                (3h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n225 km\n2h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n107 km\n58min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                332 km \n                (3h 16min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    412 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    368 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    332 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric (MY22), which was available to order from February 2021 until May 2022. \n\t\tThe previous model had 15 km less range, same acceleration and was 5% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric (MY22) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric.\nRead more about rapid charging of the Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric on the Fastned website.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n270 km\n2h 27min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n138 km\n1h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n237 km\n2h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n121 km\n1h 6min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                358 km \n                (3h 30min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n212 km\n1h 55min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n108 km\n59min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                319 km \n                (3h 9min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    408 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    358 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    319 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX90 Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n413 km\n3h 45min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n203 km\n1h 51min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366 km\n3h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n180 km\n1h 38min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                546 km \n                (5h 13min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n329 km\n2h 59min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                490 km \n                (4h 42min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    616 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    546 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    490 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX90 Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n396 km\n3h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n194 km\n1h 46min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n351 km\n3h 11min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n172 km\n1h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                523 km \n                (5h 0min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n315 km\n2h 52min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n154 km\n1h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                469 km \n                (4h 31min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    591 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    523 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    469 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor.\nRead more about rapid charging of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor on the Fastned website.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n275 km\n2h 30min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n142 km\n1h 17min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n242 km\n2h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n125 km\n1h 8min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                367 km \n                (3h 35min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n216 km\n1h 58min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n112 km\n1h 1min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                328 km \n                (3h 14min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    417 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    367 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    328 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric (MY23), which was available to order from February 2022 until April 2023. \n\t\tThe previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was 5% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric (MY23) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n325 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n169 km\n1h 32min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n287 km\n2h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n149 km\n1h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                436 km \n                (4h 12min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    493 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    436 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n310 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n272 km\n2h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n142 km\n1h 17min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                414 km \n                (4h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 km\n2h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                369 km \n                (3h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    472 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    414 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    369 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric (MY23), which was available to order from February 2022 until April 2023. \n\t\tThe previous model had 35 km less range, same acceleration and was 4% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric (MY23) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n288 km\n2h 37min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n149 km\n1h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n253 km\n2h 18min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n131 km\n1h 11min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                383 km \n                (3h 44min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n225 km\n2h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n116 km\n1h 3min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                341 km \n                (3h 21min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    437 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    383 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    341 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric (MY23), which was available to order from February 2022 until April 2023. \n\t\tThe previous model had 20 km less range, same acceleration and was 8% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric (MY23) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo C40 Recharge Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n342 km\n3h 6min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n178 km\n1h 37min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n299 km\n2h 43min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                454 km \n                (4h 23min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n265 km\n2h 25min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n138 km\n1h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                403 km \n                (3h 55min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    520 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    454 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    403 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n329 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n171 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n288 km\n2h 37min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                438 km \n                (4h 14min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    500 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    438 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric (MY22-23), which was available to order from April 2021 until April 2023. \n\t\tThe previous model had 40 km less range, same acceleration and was 5% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric (MY22-23) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo C40 Recharge Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX30 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX30 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX30 Single Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX30 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            1.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n225 km\n2h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n124 km\n1h 8min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n197 km\n1h 48min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n109 km\n59min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                306 km \n                (3h 2min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n176 km\n1h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n97 km\n53min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                273 km \n                (2h 44min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    349 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    306 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    273 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX30 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX30 Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX30 Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX30 Single Motor ER.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX30 Single Motor ER        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n302 km\n2h 44min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n168 km\n1h 32min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n264 km\n2h 24min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n147 km\n1h 20min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                411 km \n                (3h 59min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n234 km\n2h 8min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n131 km\n1h 11min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                365 km \n                (3h 34min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    470 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    411 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    365 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX30 Single Motor ER\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n279 km\n2h 32min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n246 km\n2h 14min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n137 km\n1h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                384 km \n                (3h 44min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n221 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n123 km\n1h 7min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                344 km \n                (3h 22min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    434 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    384 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    344 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX90 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX90 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX90 Single Motor.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX90 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n396 km\n3h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n200 km\n1h 49min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n348 km\n3h 10min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n175 km\n1h 36min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                524 km \n                (5h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n310 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n156 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                467 km \n                (4h 29min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    596 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    524 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    467 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX90 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n279 km\n2h 32min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n148 km\n1h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n247 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n131 km\n1h 11min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                378 km \n                (3h 41min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n221 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n117 km\n1h 4min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                338 km \n                (3h 19min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    427 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    378 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    338 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor (MY24), which was available to order from December 2022 until March 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had 5 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n325 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n169 km\n1h 32min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n287 km\n2h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n149 km\n1h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                436 km \n                (4h 12min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    493 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    436 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER (MY24), which was available to order from January 2022 until February 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Single Motor ER\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n310 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n272 km\n2h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n142 km\n1h 17min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                414 km \n                (4h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 km\n2h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                369 km \n                (3h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    472 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    414 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    369 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n137 km\n1h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                394 km \n                (3h 50min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n229 km\n2h 5min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n122 km\n1h 6min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                351 km \n                (3h 26min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    448 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    394 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    351 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor (MY24), which was available to order from December 2022 until March 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had 5 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n342 km\n3h 6min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n178 km\n1h 37min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n299 km\n2h 43min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                454 km \n                (4h 23min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n265 km\n2h 25min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n138 km\n1h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                403 km \n                (3h 55min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    520 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    454 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    403 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER (MY24), which was available to order from January 2022 until February 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Single Motor ER\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n329 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n171 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n288 km\n2h 37min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                438 km \n                (4h 14min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    500 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    438 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n310 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n272 km\n2h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n142 km\n1h 17min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                414 km \n                (4h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 km\n2h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                369 km \n                (3h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    472 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    414 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    369 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor (MY24), which was available to order from December 2022 until March 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n329 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n171 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n288 km\n2h 37min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                438 km \n                (4h 14min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    500 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    438 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Motor (MY24), which was available to order from December 2022 until March 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Motor (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX30 Cross Country. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX30 Cross Country can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX30 Cross Country.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX30 Cross Country        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n270 km\n2h 27min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n237 km\n2h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n132 km\n1h 12min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                369 km \n                (3h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n211 km\n1h 55min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n118 km\n1h 4min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                329 km \n                (3h 14min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    420 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    369 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    329 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX30 Cross Country\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo ES90 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo ES90 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo ES90 Single Motor.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo ES90 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            4 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n410 km\n3h 44min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n262 km\n2h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n357 km\n3h 15min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n228 km\n2h 4min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                584 km \n                (5h 34min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n316 km\n2h 52min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n201 km\n1h 50min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                517 km \n                (4h 57min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    672 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    584 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    517 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo ES90 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo ES90 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo ES90 Twin Motor.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo ES90 Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            4.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n450 km\n4h 5min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n284 km\n2h 35min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n394 km\n3h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n248 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                642 km \n                (6h 5min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n350 km\n3h 11min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n221 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                571 km \n                (5h 26min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    734 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    642 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    571 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo ES90 Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo ES90 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo ES90 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            4.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n450 km\n4h 5min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n284 km\n2h 35min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n394 km\n3h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n248 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                642 km \n                (6h 5min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n350 km\n3h 11min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n221 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                571 km \n                (5h 26min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    734 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    642 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    571 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo ES90 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n137 km\n1h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                394 km \n                (3h 50min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n229 km\n2h 5min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n122 km\n1h 6min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                351 km \n                (3h 26min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    448 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    394 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    351 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EC40 Single Motor (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EC40 Single Motor (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n342 km\n3h 6min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n178 km\n1h 37min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n299 km\n2h 43min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                454 km \n                (4h 23min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n265 km\n2h 25min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n138 km\n1h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                403 km \n                (3h 55min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    520 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    454 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    403 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Single Motor ER\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n329 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n171 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n288 km\n2h 37min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                438 km \n                (4h 14min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    500 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    438 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor (MY25), which was available to order from January 2022 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EC40 Twin Motor (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n329 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n171 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n288 km\n2h 37min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                438 km \n                (4h 14min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    500 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    438 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n279 km\n2h 32min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n148 km\n1h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n247 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n131 km\n1h 11min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                378 km \n                (3h 41min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n221 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n117 km\n1h 4min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                338 km \n                (3h 19min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    427 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    378 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    338 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX40 Single Motor (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EX40 Single Motor (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n325 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n169 km\n1h 32min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n287 km\n2h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n149 km\n1h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                436 km \n                (4h 12min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    493 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    436 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Single Motor ER\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n310 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n272 km\n2h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n142 km\n1h 17min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                414 km \n                (4h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 km\n2h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                369 km \n                (3h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    472 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    414 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    369 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor (MY25), which was available to order from January 2022 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EX40 Twin Motor (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n310 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n272 km\n2h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n142 km\n1h 17min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                414 km \n                (4h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 km\n2h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                369 km \n                (3h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    472 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    414 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    369 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX90 Single Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX90 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n346 km\n3h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n221 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n306 km\n2h 47min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n195 km\n1h 46min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                501 km \n                (4h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n274 km\n2h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n175 km\n1h 35min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                449 km \n                (4h 19min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    567 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    501 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    449 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX90 Single Motor (MY24-25), which was available to order from July 2023 until November 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 60 km more range, 24% slower acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EX90 Single Motor (MY24-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX90 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX90 Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n396 km\n3h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n249 km\n2h 16min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n348 km\n3h 10min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n219 km\n1h 59min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                567 km \n                (5h 24min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n310 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n195 km\n1h 47min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                506 km \n                (4h 51min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    645 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    567 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    506 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor (MY24-25), which was available to order from December 2022 until November 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 25 km more range, 7% slower acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EX90 Twin Motor (MY24-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX90 Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n378 km\n3h 26min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n238 km\n2h 10min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n336 km\n3h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n211 km\n1h 55min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                547 km \n                (5h 13min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n302 km\n2h 45min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n190 km\n1h 44min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                492 km \n                (4h 44min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    616 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    547 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    492 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance (MY24-25), which was available to order from December 2022 until November 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 20 km more range, 17% slower acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance (MY24-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX60 P6. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX60 P6 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX60 P6.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX60 P6        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n379 km\n3h 27min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n265 km\n2h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n330 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n231 km\n2h 6min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                562 km \n                (5h 21min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n205 km\n1h 52min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                498 km \n                (4h 47min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    644 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    562 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    498 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX60 P6\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX60 P10 AWD. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX60 P10 AWD can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX60 P10 AWD.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX60 P10 AWD        \n    \n\n            4 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n418 km\n3h 48min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n365 km\n3h 19min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n256 km\n2h 19min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                620 km \n                (5h 53min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n324 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n227 km\n2h 4min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                551 km \n                (5h 16min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    711 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    620 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    551 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX60 P10 AWD\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX60 P12 AWD. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX60 P12 AWD can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX60 P12 AWD.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX60 P12 AWD        \n    \n\n            5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n509 km\n4h 38min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n340 km\n3h 6min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n445 km\n4h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n297 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                742 km \n                (7h 0min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n395 km\n3h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n264 km\n2h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                659 km \n                (6h 15min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    849 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    742 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    659 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX60 P12 AWD\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX60 Cross Country P10 AWD. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX60 Cross Country P10 AWD can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX60 Cross Country P10 AWD.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX60 Cross Country P10 AWD        \n    \n\n            4 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n405 km\n3h 41min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n284 km\n2h 35min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n355 km\n3h 13min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n248 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                603 km \n                (5h 43min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n315 km\n2h 52min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n221 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                536 km \n                (5h 7min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    690 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    603 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    536 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX60 Cross Country P10 AWD\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",
