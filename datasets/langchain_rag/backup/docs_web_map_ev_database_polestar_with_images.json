Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2.\nRead more about rapid charging of the Polestar 2 on the Fastned website.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n325 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n154 km\n1h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n284 km\n2h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n135 km\n1h 14min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                419 km \n                (4h 4min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n252 km\n2h 17min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n120 km\n1h 5min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                372 km \n                (3h 37min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    479 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    419 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    372 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n287 km\n2h 37min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n125 km\n1h 8min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n250 km\n2h 16min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n108 km\n59min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                358 km \n                (3h 30min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n220 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n96 km\n52min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                316 km \n                (3h 7min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    412 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    358 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    316 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n352 km\n3h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n167 km\n1h 31min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n305 km\n2h 47min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n145 km\n1h 19min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                451 km \n                (4h 21min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n270 km\n2h 27min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n128 km\n1h 10min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                398 km \n                (3h 52min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    519 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    451 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    398 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor.\nRead more about rapid charging of the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor on the Fastned website.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n325 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n154 km\n1h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n284 km\n2h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n135 km\n1h 14min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                419 km \n                (4h 4min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n252 km\n2h 17min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n120 km\n1h 5min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                372 km \n                (3h 37min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    479 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    419 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    372 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 (MY20), which was available to order from August 2020 until May 2021. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 (MY20) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n311 km\n2h 50min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n273 km\n2h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n141 km\n1h 17min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                414 km \n                (4h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 km\n2h 13min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                369 km \n                (3h 37min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    472 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    414 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    369 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY21), which was available to order from September 2021 until March 2022. \n\t\tThe previous model had 30 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY21) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 3 Long Range Dual motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 3 Long Range Dual motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 3 Long Range Dual motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 3 Long Range Dual motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n422 km\n3h 50min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n207 km\n1h 53min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n373 km\n3h 23min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n183 km\n1h 40min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                555 km \n                (5h 18min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n333 km\n3h 2min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n163 km\n1h 29min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                497 km \n                (4h 46min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    630 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    555 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    497 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 3 Long Range Dual motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 3 Long Range Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 3 Long Range Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 3 Long Range Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 3 Long Range Performance        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n391 km\n3h 34min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n192 km\n1h 45min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n346 km\n3h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n170 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                516 km \n                (4h 57min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n311 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n152 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                463 km \n                (4h 27min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    583 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    516 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    463 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 3 Long Range Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Performance        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n315 km\n2h 52min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n277 km\n2h 31min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n132 km\n1h 12min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                409 km \n                (3h 58min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n247 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n118 km\n1h 4min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                365 km \n                (3h 34min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    466 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    409 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    365 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n334 km\n3h 2min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n172 km\n1h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n290 km\n2h 38min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                439 km \n                (4h 15min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n256 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n132 km\n1h 12min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                388 km \n                (3h 47min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    506 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    439 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    388 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY22-23), which was available to order from March 2022 until October 2022. \n\t\tThe previous model had 20 km less range, 16% slower acceleration and was 5% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY22-23) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n395 km\n3h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n205 km\n1h 52min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n345 km\n3h 8min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n179 km\n1h 38min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                525 km \n                (5h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n306 km\n2h 47min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n159 km\n1h 27min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                466 km \n                (4h 29min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    600 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    525 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    466 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor (MY21-22), which was available to order from September 2021 until January 2023. \n\t\tThe previous model had 50 km less range, 19% slower acceleration and was 7% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor (MY21-22) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n378 km\n3h 26min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n197 km\n1h 47min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n330 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n172 km\n1h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                501 km \n                (4h 49min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n152 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                445 km \n                (4h 18min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    575 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    501 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    445 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor (MY21-23), which was available to order from September 2021 until January 2023. \n\t\tThe previous model had 60 km less range, 4% slower acceleration and was 9% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor (MY21-23) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Performance        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n378 km\n3h 26min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n197 km\n1h 47min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n330 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n172 km\n1h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                501 km \n                (4h 49min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n152 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                445 km \n                (4h 18min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    575 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    501 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    445 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance (MY23), which was available to order from August 2022 until January 2023. \n\t\tThe previous model had 65 km less range, 5% slower acceleration and was 11% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Performance (MY23) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 4 Long Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 4 Long Range Single Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 4 Long Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n409 km\n3h 43min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n199 km\n1h 48min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n358 km\n3h 16min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n174 km\n1h 35min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                533 km \n                (5h 6min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n319 km\n2h 54min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                474 km \n                (4h 34min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    607 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    533 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    474 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 4 Long Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 4 Long Range Dual Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 4 Long Range Dual Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 4 Long Range Dual Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n401 km\n3h 39min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n195 km\n1h 46min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n353 km\n3h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n171 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                524 km \n                (5h 0min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n314 km\n2h 52min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n153 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                467 km \n                (4h 30min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    596 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    524 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    467 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 4 Long Range Dual Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n343 km\n3h 7min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n182 km\n1h 39min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n296 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n157 km\n1h 26min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                454 km \n                (4h 23min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n261 km\n2h 22min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n139 km\n1h 16min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                400 km \n                (3h 53min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    525 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    454 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    400 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY24), which was available to order from January 2023 until September 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n399 km\n3h 38min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n208 km\n1h 53min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n347 km\n3h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n180 km\n1h 38min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                527 km \n                (5h 2min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n306 km\n2h 47min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n159 km\n1h 27min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                466 km \n                (4h 29min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    607 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    527 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    466 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor (MY24), which was available to order from January 2023 until September 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had 5 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n382 km\n3h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n199 km\n1h 48min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n335 km\n3h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n174 km\n1h 35min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                509 km \n                (4h 53min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n297 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                452 km \n                (4h 21min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    581 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    509 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    452 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor (MY24), which was available to order from January 2023 until September 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had 5 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Performance        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n378 km\n3h 26min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n197 km\n1h 47min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n330 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n172 km\n1h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                501 km \n                (4h 49min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n152 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                445 km \n                (4h 18min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    575 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    501 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    445 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance (MY24), which was available to order from January 2023 until September 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Performance (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 3 Long Range Single motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 3 Long Range Single motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 3 Long Range Single motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 3 Long Range Single motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n436 km\n3h 58min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n214 km\n1h 57min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n383 km\n3h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n188 km\n1h 42min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                571 km \n                (5h 26min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n341 km\n3h 6min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n168 km\n1h 31min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                509 km \n                (4h 52min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    650 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    571 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    509 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 3 Long Range Single motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n343 km\n3h 7min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n182 km\n1h 39min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n296 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n157 km\n1h 26min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                454 km \n                (4h 23min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n261 km\n2h 22min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n139 km\n1h 16min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                400 km \n                (3h 53min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    525 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    454 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    400 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY25), which was available to order from June 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Standard Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%Time: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%Rate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\n\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n399 km\n3h 38min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n208 km\n1h 53min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n347 km\n3h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n180 km\n1h 38min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                527 km \n                (5h 2min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n306 km\n2h 47min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n159 km\n1h 27min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                466 km \n                (4h 29min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    607 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    527 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    466 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor (MY25), which was available to order from June 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Single Motor (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n382 km\n3h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n199 km\n1h 48min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n335 km\n3h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n174 km\n1h 35min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                509 km \n                (4h 53min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n297 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                452 km \n                (4h 21min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    581 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    509 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    452 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor (MY25), which was available to order from June 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Dual Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 2 Long Range Performance        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n378 km\n3h 26min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n197 km\n1h 47min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n330 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n172 km\n1h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                501 km \n                (4h 49min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n152 km\n1h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                445 km \n                (4h 18min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    575 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    501 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    445 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 2 Long Range Performance (MY25), which was available to order from June 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 2 Long Range Performance (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 2 Long Range Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 5 Dual Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 5 Dual Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 5 Dual Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 5 Dual Motor        \n    \n\n            4.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n492 km\n4h 28min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n311 km\n2h 50min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n428 km\n3h 53min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n270 km\n2h 27min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                698 km \n                (6h 35min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n379 km\n3h 26min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n239 km\n2h 11min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                618 km \n                (5h 52min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    803 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    698 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    618 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 5 Dual Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 5 Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 5 Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 5 Performance.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 5 Performance        \n    \n\n            4 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n446 km\n4h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n282 km\n2h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n390 km\n3h 33min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n247 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                637 km \n                (6h 3min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n347 km\n3h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n219 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                566 km \n                (5h 24min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    728 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    637 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    566 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 5 Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 3 Rear Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 3 Rear Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 3 Rear Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 3 Rear Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n360 km\n3h 16min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n230 km\n2h 5min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n317 km\n2h 53min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n203 km\n1h 50min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                520 km \n                (4h 58min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n284 km\n2h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n181 km\n1h 39min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                465 km \n                (4h 29min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    590 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    520 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    465 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 3 Long Range Single motor (MY23-25), which was available to order from June 2024 until October 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 90 km more range, 20% slower acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 3 Long Range Single motor (MY23-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 3 Rear Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 3 Dual Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 3 Dual Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 3 Dual Motor.\nMax.

Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 3 Dual Motor        \n    \n\n            4 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n410 km\n3h 44min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n258 km\n2h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n362 km\n3h 18min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n228 km\n2h 4min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                590 km \n                (5h 37min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n324 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n204 km\n1h 51min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                529 km \n                (5h 3min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    668 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    590 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    529 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 3 Long Range Dual motor (MY23-25), which was available to order from November 2022 until October 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 15 km more range, 6% slower acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 3 Long Range Dual motor (MY23-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 3 Dual Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Polestar 3 Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Polestar 3 Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Polestar 3 Performance.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Polestar 3 Performance        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n373 km\n3h 24min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n235 km\n2h 8min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n331 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n208 km\n1h 54min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                539 km \n                (5h 9min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n297 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n187 km\n1h 42min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                484 km \n                (4h 39min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    608 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    539 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    484 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Polestar 3 Long Range Performance (MY23-25), which was available to order from November 2022 until October 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 20 km more range, 21% slower acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Polestar 3 Long Range Performance (MY23-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolestar 3 Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",
