Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n266 km\n2h 25min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n236 km\n2h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n112 km\n1h 1min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                348 km \n                (3h 25min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n212 km\n1h 55min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n101 km\n55min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                312 km \n                (3h 5min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    392 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    348 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    312 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n292 km\n2h 39min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n139 km\n1h 16min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n122 km\n1h 7min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                379 km \n                (3h 42min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n230 km\n2h 5min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n109 km\n1h 0min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                339 km \n                (3h 20min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    431 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    379 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    339 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n266 km\n2h 25min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n236 km\n2h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n112 km\n1h 1min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                348 km \n                (3h 25min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n212 km\n1h 55min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n101 km\n55min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                312 km \n                (3h 5min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    392 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    348 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    312 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge (MY21), which was available to order from February 2020 until May 2021. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 P8 AWD Recharge (MY21) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 km\n2h 13min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n124 km\n1h 7min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n215 km\n1h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n110 km\n1h 0min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                325 km \n                (3h 12min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n193 km\n1h 45min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n98 km\n54min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                292 km \n                (2h 54min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    367 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    325 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    292 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric.\nRead more about rapid charging of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric on the Fastned website.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n266 km\n2h 25min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n135 km\n1h 14min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n236 km\n2h 8min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n120 km\n1h 5min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                355 km \n                (3h 28min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n212 km\n1h 55min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n108 km\n59min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                319 km \n                (3h 9min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    401 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    355 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    319 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric (MY22), which was available to order from February 2021 until May 2022. \n\t\tThe previous model had 25 km less range, same acceleration and was 8% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric (MY22) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric.\nRead more about rapid charging of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric on the Fastned website.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n279 km\n2h 32min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 12min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n249 km\n2h 16min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n119 km\n1h 5min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                368 km \n                (3h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n225 km\n2h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n107 km\n58min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                332 km \n                (3h 16min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    412 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    368 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    332 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric (MY22), which was available to order from February 2021 until May 2022. \n\t\tThe previous model had 15 km less range, same acceleration and was 5% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric (MY22) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n270 km\n2h 27min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n138 km\n1h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n237 km\n2h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n121 km\n1h 6min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                358 km \n                (3h 30min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n212 km\n1h 55min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n108 km\n59min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                319 km \n                (3h 9min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    408 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    358 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    319 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX90 Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n413 km\n3h 45min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n203 km\n1h 51min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n366 km\n3h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n180 km\n1h 38min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                546 km \n                (5h 13min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n329 km\n2h 59min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                490 km \n                (4h 42min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    616 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    546 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    490 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX90 Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n396 km\n3h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n194 km\n1h 46min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n351 km\n3h 11min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n172 km\n1h 34min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                523 km \n                (5h 0min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n315 km\n2h 52min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n154 km\n1h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                469 km \n                (4h 31min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    591 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    523 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    469 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n275 km\n2h 30min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n142 km\n1h 17min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n242 km\n2h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n125 km\n1h 8min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                367 km \n                (3h 35min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n216 km\n1h 58min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n112 km\n1h 1min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                328 km \n                (3h 14min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    417 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    367 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    328 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric (MY23), which was available to order from February 2022 until April 2023. \n\t\tThe previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was 5% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Pure Electric (MY23) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n325 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n169 km\n1h 32min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n287 km\n2h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n149 km\n1h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                436 km \n                (4h 12min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    493 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    436 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n310 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n272 km\n2h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n142 km\n1h 17min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                414 km \n                (4h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 km\n2h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                369 km \n                (3h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    472 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    414 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    369 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric (MY23), which was available to order from February 2022 until April 2023. \n\t\tThe previous model had 35 km less range, same acceleration and was 4% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric (MY23) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor.\nRead more about rapid charging of the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor on the Fastned website.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n288 km\n2h 37min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n149 km\n1h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n253 km\n2h 18min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n131 km\n1h 11min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                383 km \n                (3h 44min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n225 km\n2h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n116 km\n1h 3min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                341 km \n                (3h 21min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    437 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    383 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    341 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric (MY23), which was available to order from February 2022 until April 2023. \n\t\tThe previous model had 20 km less range, same acceleration and was 8% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo C40 Recharge Pure Electric (MY23) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo C40 Recharge Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n342 km\n3h 6min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n178 km\n1h 37min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n299 km\n2h 43min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                454 km \n                (4h 23min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n265 km\n2h 25min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n138 km\n1h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                403 km \n                (3h 55min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    520 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    454 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    403 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Motor.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n329 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n171 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n288 km\n2h 37min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                438 km \n                (4h 14min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    500 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    438 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric (MY22-23), which was available to order from April 2021 until April 2023. \n\t\tThe previous model had 40 km less range, same acceleration and was 5% less energy efficient.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Pure Electric (MY22-23) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo C40 Recharge Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX30 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX30 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX30 Single Motor.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX30 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            1.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n225 km\n2h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n124 km\n1h 8min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n197 km\n1h 48min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n109 km\n59min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                306 km \n                (3h 2min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n176 km\n1h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n97 km\n53min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                273 km \n                (2h 44min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    349 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    306 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    273 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX30 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX30 Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX30 Single Motor ER        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n302 km\n2h 44min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n168 km\n1h 32min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n264 km\n2h 24min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n147 km\n1h 20min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                411 km \n                (3h 59min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n234 km\n2h 8min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n131 km\n1h 11min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                365 km \n                (3h 34min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    470 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    411 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    365 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX30 Single Motor ER\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n279 km\n2h 32min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n246 km\n2h 14min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n137 km\n1h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                384 km \n                (3h 44min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n221 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n123 km\n1h 7min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                344 km \n                (3h 22min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    434 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    384 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    344 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX30 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX90 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX90 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX90 Single Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX90 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n396 km\n3h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n200 km\n1h 49min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n348 km\n3h 10min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n175 km\n1h 36min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                524 km \n                (5h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n310 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n156 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                467 km \n                (4h 29min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    596 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    524 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    467 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX90 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n279 km\n2h 32min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n148 km\n1h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n247 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n131 km\n1h 11min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                378 km \n                (3h 41min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n221 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n117 km\n1h 4min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                338 km \n                (3h 19min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    427 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    378 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    338 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor (MY24), which was available to order from December 2022 until March 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had 5 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n325 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n169 km\n1h 32min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n287 km\n2h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n149 km\n1h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                436 km \n                (4h 12min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    493 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    436 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER (MY24), which was available to order from January 2022 until February 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Single Motor ER (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Single Motor ER\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n310 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n272 km\n2h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n142 km\n1h 17min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                414 km \n                (4h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 km\n2h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                369 km \n                (3h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    472 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    414 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    369 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n137 km\n1h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                394 km \n                (3h 50min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n229 km\n2h 5min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n122 km\n1h 6min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                351 km \n                (3h 26min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    448 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    394 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    351 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor (MY24), which was available to order from December 2022 until March 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had 5 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n342 km\n3h 6min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n178 km\n1h 37min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n299 km\n2h 43min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                454 km \n                (4h 23min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n265 km\n2h 25min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n138 km\n1h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                403 km \n                (3h 55min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    520 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    454 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    403 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER (MY24), which was available to order from January 2022 until February 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo C40 Recharge Single Motor ER (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Single Motor ER\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n329 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n171 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n288 km\n2h 37min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                438 km \n                (4h 14min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    500 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    438 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n310 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n272 km\n2h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n142 km\n1h 17min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                414 km \n                (4h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 km\n2h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                369 km \n                (3h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    472 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    414 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    369 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor (MY24), which was available to order from December 2022 until March 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo XC40 Recharge Twin Motor (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n329 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n171 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n288 km\n2h 37min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                438 km \n                (4h 14min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    500 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    438 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Motor (MY24), which was available to order from December 2022 until March 2024. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo C40 Recharge Twin Motor (MY24) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX30 Cross Country. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX30 Cross Country can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX30 Cross Country.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX30 Cross Country        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n270 km\n2h 27min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n237 km\n2h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n132 km\n1h 12min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                369 km \n                (3h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n211 km\n1h 55min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n118 km\n1h 4min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                329 km \n                (3h 14min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    420 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    369 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    329 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX30 Cross Country\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo ES90 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo ES90 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo ES90 Single Motor.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo ES90 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            4 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n410 km\n3h 44min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n262 km\n2h 23min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n357 km\n3h 15min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n228 km\n2h 4min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                584 km \n                (5h 34min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n316 km\n2h 52min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n201 km\n1h 50min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                517 km \n                (4h 57min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    672 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    584 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    517 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo ES90 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo ES90 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo ES90 Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo ES90 Twin Motor.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo ES90 Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            4.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n450 km\n4h 5min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n284 km\n2h 35min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n394 km\n3h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n248 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                642 km \n                (6h 5min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n350 km\n3h 11min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n221 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                571 km \n                (5h 26min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    734 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    642 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    571 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo ES90 Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo ES90 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo ES90 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo ES90 Twin Motor Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo ES90 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            4.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n450 km\n4h 5min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n284 km\n2h 35min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n394 km\n3h 35min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n248 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                642 km \n                (6h 5min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n350 km\n3h 11min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n221 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                571 km \n                (5h 26min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    734 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    642 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    571 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo ES90 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n137 km\n1h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                394 km \n                (3h 50min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n229 km\n2h 5min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n122 km\n1h 6min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                351 km \n                (3h 26min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    448 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    394 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    351 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EC40 Single Motor (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EC40 Single Motor (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n342 km\n3h 6min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n178 km\n1h 37min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n299 km\n2h 43min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n155 km\n1h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                454 km \n                (4h 23min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n265 km\n2h 25min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n138 km\n1h 15min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                403 km \n                (3h 55min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    520 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    454 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    403 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EC40 Single Motor ER (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Single Motor ER\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n329 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n171 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n288 km\n2h 37min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                438 km \n                (4h 14min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    500 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    438 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor (MY25), which was available to order from January 2022 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EC40 Twin Motor (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n329 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n171 km\n1h 33min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n288 km\n2h 37min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n150 km\n1h 22min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                438 km \n                (4h 14min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    500 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    438 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EC40 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            2 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n279 km\n2h 32min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n148 km\n1h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n247 km\n2h 15min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n131 km\n1h 11min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                378 km \n                (3h 41min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n221 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n117 km\n1h 4min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                338 km \n                (3h 19min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    427 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    378 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    338 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX40 Single Motor (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EX40 Single Motor (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n325 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n169 km\n1h 32min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n287 km\n2h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n149 km\n1h 21min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                436 km \n                (4h 12min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n257 km\n2h 20min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n133 km\n1h 13min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                390 km \n                (3h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    493 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    436 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    390 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EX40 Single Motor ER (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Single Motor ER\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n310 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n272 km\n2h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n142 km\n1h 17min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                414 km \n                (4h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 km\n2h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                369 km \n                (3h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    472 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    414 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    369 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor (MY25), which was available to order from January 2022 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EX40 Twin Motor (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            2.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n310 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n161 km\n1h 28min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n272 km\n2h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n142 km\n1h 17min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                414 km \n                (4h 1min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n243 km\n2h 12min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n126 km\n1h 9min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                369 km \n                (3h 36min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    472 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    414 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    369 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance (MY25), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance (MY25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX40 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX90 Single Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX90 Single Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX90 Single Motor.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX90 Single Motor        \n    \n\n            3 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n346 km\n3h 9min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n221 km\n2h 0min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n306 km\n2h 47min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n195 km\n1h 46min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                501 km \n                (4h 48min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n274 km\n2h 29min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n175 km\n1h 35min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                449 km \n                (4h 19min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    567 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    501 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    449 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX90 Single Motor (MY24-25), which was available to order from July 2023 until November 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 60 km more range, 24% slower acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EX90 Single Motor (MY24-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX90 Single Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles.

The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX90 Twin Motor        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n396 km\n3h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n249 km\n2h 16min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n348 km\n3h 10min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n219 km\n1h 59min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                567 km \n                (5h 24min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n310 km\n2h 49min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n195 km\n1h 47min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                506 km \n                (4h 51min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    645 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    567 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    506 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor (MY24-25), which was available to order from December 2022 until November 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 25 km more range, 7% slower acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EX90 Twin Motor (MY24-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX90 Twin Motor\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n378 km\n3h 26min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n238 km\n2h 10min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n336 km\n3h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n211 km\n1h 55min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                547 km \n                (5h 13min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n302 km\n2h 45min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n190 km\n1h 44min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                492 km \n                (4h 44min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    616 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    547 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    492 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nPreceding model\n\n\t\tThe model shown on this page is the successor of the Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance (MY24-25), which was available to order from December 2022 until November 2025. \n\t\tThe previous model had 20 km more range, 17% slower acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n\t\t\n\n\n\tPreceding model Volvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance (MY24-25) \n\n \n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX90 Twin Motor Performance\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX60 P6. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX60 P6 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX60 P6.\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX60 P6        \n    \n\n            3.5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n379 km\n3h 27min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n265 km\n2h 25min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n330 km\n3h 0min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n231 km\n2h 6min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                562 km \n                (5h 21min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n205 km\n1h 52min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                498 km \n                (4h 47min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    644 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    562 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    498 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX60 P6\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX60 P10 AWD. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX60 P10 AWD can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX60 P10 AWD.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX60 P10 AWD        \n    \n\n            4 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n418 km\n3h 48min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n293 km\n2h 40min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n365 km\n3h 19min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n256 km\n2h 19min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                620 km \n                (5h 53min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n324 km\n2h 57min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n227 km\n2h 4min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                551 km \n                (5h 16min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    711 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    620 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    551 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX60 P10 AWD\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX60 P12 AWD. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX60 P12 AWD can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX60 P12 AWD.\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.1-Stop RangeThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating.            \n\n\n\n\n    Volvo EX60 P12 AWD        \n    \n\n            5 / 5\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 \n\n\n\n1 \n\n\n\n2 \n\n\n\n3 \n\n\n\n4 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n509 km\n4h 38min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n340 km\n3h 6min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n445 km\n4h 3min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n297 km\n2h 42min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                742 km \n                (7h 0min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n395 km\n3h 36min\n\n\n\n15 min\n\n\n264 km\n2h 24min\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                659 km \n                (6h 15min)\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0 km\n\n\n\n100\n\n\n\n200\n\n\n\n300\n\n\n\n400\n\n\n\n500\n\n\n\n600\n\n\n\n700\n\n\n\n800\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMild Weather\n\n                    849 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nAverage Conditions\n\n                    742 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\nCold Weather\n\n                    659 km \n                    1-Stop Range                \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Advertisement)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolvo EX60 P12 AWD\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHEATSHEETS MISSING VEHICLES DATA SERVICES\nCONTACT & ABOUT\nDISCLAIMER  \n\n\nEuropean Overview\nThe Netherlands\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nCompare\n\n\n\n",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the Volvo EX60 Cross Country P10 AWD. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\nEurope\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the Volvo EX60 Cross Country P10 AWD can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\n\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharging Point\nMax.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the Volvo EX60 Cross Country P10 AWD.\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge pointAvg.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n\n\n\n1-Stop Range\n+\n\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.Driving ProfileStart with a fully charged batteryDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)Fast charge: 15 minutesDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)AssumptionsSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range HighwayNo time required for starting and stopping the charging sessionThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicleThe battery is in optimal conditionIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions. \n\n\n\n5-Star Rating\n+\n\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            0 \n\n\n                                                                            less than 200 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            1 \n\n\n                                                                            from 200 km to 325 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            2 \n\n\n                                                                            from 325 km to 450 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            3 \n\n\n                                                                            from 450 km to 575 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            4 \n\n\n                                                                            from 575 km to 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n                                                                            5 \n\n\n                                                                            more than 700 km                                                                    \n\n\n\n\n                    Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.
