No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i3 60 Ah. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i3 60 Ah can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n9h45m\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n6 hours\n\n19 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n3 hours\n\n38 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW †\n\n6 hours\n\n19 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW †\n\n3 hours\n\n38 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i3 60 Ah.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%\nTime: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%\nRate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2) *\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nAvg. \nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nCCS \n(50 kW DC)\n\n47 kW †\n\n41 kW †\n\n20 min\n\n240 km/h\n\n Charge Curve \n\nData made available by Fastned\n\n This vehicle supports Autocharge \n \n\n This vehicle does not support Plug & Charge \n \n\n† = Limited by charging capabilities of vehicle\nAutocharge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations.\nPlug & Charge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations in accordance with ISO 15118.\nActual charging rates may differ from data shown due to factors like outside temperature, state of the battery and driving style.\n* = Optional in some countries\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nThe table below shows the claimed specifications from the manufacturer for charging the BMW i3 60 Ah. The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 50 kW \n \n\n 0 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 30 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i3 60 Ah \n \n\n 0 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n95 km\n\n52min\n\n15 min\n\n59 km\n\n32min\n\n82 km\n\n45min\n\n15 min\n\n51 km\n\n28min\n\n 133 km \n (1h 28min)\n \n\n72 km\n\n39min\n\n15 min\n\n45 km\n\n24min\n\n 117 km \n (1h 18min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 153 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 133 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 117 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i3 60 Ah\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i3 94 Ah. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i3 94 Ah can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nStandard 7.4 kW On-Board Charger\n\n \n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n14 hours\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n19 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n4h30m\n\n37 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW †\n\n8h45m\n\n19 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW †\n\n4h30m\n\n37 km/h\n\nOptional 11.0kW On-Board Charger *\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n14 hours\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n19 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n4h30m\n\n37 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n3 hours\n\n55 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n3 hours\n\n55 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n \n* = Optional in some countries, standard in others. Check local specifications for details.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i3 94 Ah.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 50 kW \n \n\n 0 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 40 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i3 94 Ah \n \n\n 0 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n135 km\n\n1h 14min\n\n15 min\n\n61 km\n\n33min\n\n117 km\n\n1h 4min\n\n15 min\n\n53 km\n\n29min\n\n 170 km \n (1h 48min)\n \n\n103 km\n\n56min\n\n15 min\n\n47 km\n\n25min\n\n 150 km \n (1h 36min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 196 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 170 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 150 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i3 60 Ah, which was available to order from September 2013 until February 2017. \n The previous model had 50 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW i3 60 Ah \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i3 94 Ah\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i3 94 Ah.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i3 94 Ah \n \n\n 0 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n135 km\n\n1h 14min\n\n15 min\n\n61 km\n\n33min\n\n117 km\n\n1h 4min\n\n15 min\n\n53 km\n\n29min\n\n 170 km \n (1h 48min)\n \n\n103 km\n\n56min\n\n15 min\n\n47 km\n\n25min\n\n 150 km \n (1h 36min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 196 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 170 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 150 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i3 94 Ah, which was available to order from July 2016 until August 2017. \n The previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW i3 94 Ah \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i3 94 Ah\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX3. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX3 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n38 hours\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n23h45m\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n11h45m\n\n33 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8 hours\n\n48 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8 hours\n\n48 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC.

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i3 120 Ah. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i3 120 Ah can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n19h30m\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n12h15m\n\n19 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n6h15m\n\n38 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n4h15m\n\n55 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n4h15m\n\n55 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i3 120 Ah.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i3 120 Ah \n \n\n 1 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n194 km\n\n1h 46min\n\n15 min\n\n63 km\n\n34min\n\n168 km\n\n1h 32min\n\n15 min\n\n54 km\n\n30min\n\n 222 km \n (2h 17min)\n \n\n148 km\n\n1h 21min\n\n15 min\n\n48 km\n\n26min\n\n 196 km \n (2h 2min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 257 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 222 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 196 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i3 94 Ah, which was available to order from October 2017 until October 2018. \n The previous model had 70 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW i3 94 Ah \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i3 120 Ah\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i3s 120 Ah. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i3s 120 Ah can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n19h30m\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n12h15m\n\n19 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n6h15m\n\n37 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n4h15m\n\n54 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n4h15m\n\n54 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i3s 120 Ah.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i3s 120 Ah \n \n\n 1 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n184 km\n\n1h 41min\n\n15 min\n\n60 km\n\n33min\n\n162 km\n\n1h 28min\n\n15 min\n\n52 km\n\n29min\n\n 214 km \n (2h 12min)\n \n\n144 km\n\n1h 19min\n\n15 min\n\n47 km\n\n25min\n\n 191 km \n (1h 59min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 244 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 214 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 191 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i3s 94 Ah, which was available to order from October 2017 until October 2018. \n The previous model had 70 km less range, same acceleration and was 3% less energy efficient.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW i3s 94 Ah \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i3s 120 Ah\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 eDrive40. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 eDrive40 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h30m\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n25h45m\n\n20 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n40 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n59 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h45m\n\n59 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 eDrive40.\n\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 32 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i4 eDrive40 \n \n\n 4 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n438 km\n\n3h 59min\n\n15 min\n\n238 km\n\n2h 10min\n\n378 km\n\n3h 26min\n\n15 min\n\n206 km\n\n1h 52min\n\n 584 km \n (5h 33min)\n \n\n333 km\n\n3h 2min\n\n15 min\n\n181 km\n\n1h 39min\n\n 514 km \n (4h 56min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 675 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 584 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 514 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i4 eDrive40\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW iX xDrive40 \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n297 km\n\n2h 42min\n\n15 min\n\n144 km\n\n1h 18min\n\n262 km\n\n2h 23min\n\n15 min\n\n127 km\n\n1h 9min\n\n 388 km \n (3h 47min)\n \n\n234 km\n\n2h 8min\n\n15 min\n\n113 km\n\n1h 2min\n\n 347 km \n (3h 25min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 441 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 388 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 347 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW iX xDrive40\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 M50. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 M50 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h30m\n\n11 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n25h45m\n\n17 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n35 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n51 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h45m\n\n51 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 M50.\n\nMax.

Average energy consumption and range based on moderate drive style and climate. Real-life values may differ significantly. Pricing information might not be actual for some regions. No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX3. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX3 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n38 hours\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n23h45m\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n11h45m\n\n33 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8 hours\n\n48 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8 hours\n\n48 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX3.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%\nTime: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%\nRate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nAvg. \nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nCCS \n(50 kW DC)\n\n48 kW †\n\n46 kW †\n\n71 min\n\n220 km/h\n\nCCS \n(175 kW DC)\n\n136 kW †\n\n100 kW †\n\n33 min\n\n490 km/h\n\nCCS \n(300 kW DC)\n\n155 kW †\n\n104 kW †\n\n31 min\n\n520 km/h\n\n Charge Curve \n\nData made available by Fastned\n\n This vehicle supports Autocharge \n \n\n This vehicle does not support Plug & Charge \n \n\n† = Limited by charging capabilities of vehicle\nAutocharge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations.\nPlug & Charge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations in accordance with ISO 15118.\nActual charging rates may differ from data shown due to factors like outside temperature, state of the battery and driving style.\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nThe table below shows the claimed specifications from the manufacturer for charging the BMW iX3. The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 150 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 31 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW iX3 \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n316 km\n\n2h 52min\n\n15 min\n\n151 km\n\n1h 23min\n\n278 km\n\n2h 31min\n\n15 min\n\n133 km\n\n1h 13min\n\n 411 km \n (3h 59min)\n \n\n248 km\n\n2h 15min\n\n15 min\n\n119 km\n\n1h 5min\n\n 366 km \n (3h 35min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 467 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 411 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 366 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX3 (MY21), which was available to order from November 2020 until September 2021. \n The previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW iX3 \n(MY21)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW iX3\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX M60. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Check local specifications for details.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX M60.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 195 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 39 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW iX M60 \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n401 km\n\n3h 39min\n\n15 min\n\n183 km\n\n1h 40min\n\n353 km\n\n3h 12min\n\n15 min\n\n161 km\n\n1h 28min\n\n 514 km \n (4h 55min)\n \n\n315 km\n\n2h 52min\n\n15 min\n\n144 km\n\n1h 18min\n\n 458 km \n (4h 25min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 584 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 514 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 458 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW iX M60\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i7 xDrive60.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i7 xDrive60.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 195 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 34 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i7 xDrive60 \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n432 km\n\n3h 55min\n\n15 min\n\n211 km\n\n1h 55min\n\n379 km\n\n3h 27min\n\n15 min\n\n185 km\n\n1h 41min\n\n 564 km \n (5h 23min)\n \n\n338 km\n\n3h 4min\n\n15 min\n\n165 km\n\n1h 30min\n\n 503 km \n (4h 49min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 643 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 564 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 503 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i7 xDrive60\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW iX1 xDrive30 \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n320 km\n\n2h 55min\n\n15 min\n\n153 km\n\n1h 23min\n\n276 km\n\n2h 31min\n\n15 min\n\n132 km\n\n1h 12min\n\n 408 km \n (3h 58min)\n \n\n243 km\n\n2h 12min\n\n15 min\n\n116 km\n\n1h 3min\n\n 359 km \n (3h 30min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 473 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 408 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 359 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW iX1 xDrive30\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i7 M70 xDrive. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i7 M70 xDrive can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n52h15m\n\n9 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n32h30m\n\n15 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n16h15m\n\n30 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n11 hours\n\n45 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n5h30m\n\n89 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i7 M70 xDrive.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined.

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i7 eDrive50. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i7 eDrive50 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nStandard 11.0 kW On-Board Charger\n\n \n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n52h15m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n32h30m\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n16h15m\n\n32 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n11 hours\n\n47 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n11 hours\n\n47 km/h\n\nOptional 22.0kW On-Board Charger *\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n52h15m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n32h30m\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n16h15m\n\n32 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n11 hours\n\n47 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n5h30m\n\n95 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n \n* = Optional in some countries, standard in others. Check local specifications for details.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i7 eDrive50.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 195 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 34 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i7 eDrive50 \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n440 km\n\n4h 0min\n\n15 min\n\n215 km\n\n1h 57min\n\n385 km\n\n3h 30min\n\n15 min\n\n188 km\n\n1h 42min\n\n 572 km \n (5h 27min)\n \n\n342 km\n\n3h 6min\n\n15 min\n\n167 km\n\n1h 31min\n\n 508 km \n (4h 52min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 655 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 572 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 508 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i7 eDrive50\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 30 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n395 km\n\n3h 35min\n\n15 min\n\n219 km\n\n1h 59min\n\n345 km\n\n3h 8min\n\n15 min\n\n191 km\n\n1h 44min\n\n 536 km \n (5h 7min)\n \n\n306 km\n\n2h 47min\n\n15 min\n\n169 km\n\n1h 32min\n\n 475 km \n (4h 34min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 614 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 536 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 475 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nStandard 11.0 kW On-Board Charger\n\n \n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n32 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n48 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h45m\n\n48 km/h\n\nOptional 22.0kW On-Board Charger\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n16 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n32 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n48 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n4h30m\n\n93 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan \n \n\n 3 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n351 km\n\n3h 12min\n\n15 min\n\n195 km\n\n1h 46min\n\n308 km\n\n2h 48min\n\n15 min\n\n171 km\n\n1h 33min\n\n 479 km \n (4h 36min)\n \n\n275 km\n\n2h 30min\n\n15 min\n\n152 km\n\n1h 23min\n\n 427 km \n (4h 8min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 546 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 479 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 427 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range.

To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same.

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nStandard 11.0 kW On-Board Charger\n\n \n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n11 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n18 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n35 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n52 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h45m\n\n52 km/h\n\nOptional 22.0kW On-Board Charger\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n11 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n18 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n35 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n52 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n4h30m\n\n100 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 30 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n387 km\n\n3h 31min\n\n15 min\n\n214 km\n\n1h 57min\n\n336 km\n\n3h 3min\n\n15 min\n\n186 km\n\n1h 42min\n\n 522 km \n (5h 0min)\n \n\n297 km\n\n2h 42min\n\n15 min\n\n165 km\n\n1h 30min\n\n 462 km \n (4h 27min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 601 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 522 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 462 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX2 eDrive20. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX2 eDrive20 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nStandard 11.0 kW On-Board Charger\n\n \n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n33h15m\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n20h45m\n\n19 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h30m\n\n38 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7 hours\n\n56 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n7 hours\n\n56 km/h\n\nOptional 22.0kW On-Board Charger\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n33h15m\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n20h45m\n\n19 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h30m\n\n38 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7 hours\n\n56 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n3h30m\n\n110 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX2 eDrive20.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 130 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 29 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW iX2 eDrive20 \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n333 km\n\n3h 1min\n\n15 min\n\n159 km\n\n1h 27min\n\n290 km\n\n2h 38min\n\n15 min\n\n138 km\n\n1h 15min\n\n 428 km \n (4h 8min)\n \n\n257 km\n\n2h 20min\n\n15 min\n\n123 km\n\n1h 7min\n\n 379 km \n (3h 42min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 492 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 428 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 379 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW iX2 eDrive20\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nStandard 11.0 kW On-Board Charger\n\n \n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n11 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n18 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n35 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n52 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h45m\n\n52 km/h\n\nOptional 22.0kW On-Board Charger\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n11 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n18 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n35 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n52 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n4h30m\n\n100 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 30 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n387 km\n\n3h 31min\n\n15 min\n\n214 km\n\n1h 57min\n\n336 km\n\n3h 3min\n\n15 min\n\n186 km\n\n1h 42min\n\n 522 km \n (5h 0min)\n \n\n297 km\n\n2h 42min\n\n15 min\n\n165 km\n\n1h 30min\n\n 462 km \n (4h 27min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 601 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 522 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 462 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i5 eDrive40 Touring\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Check local specifications for details.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 30 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring \n \n\n 3 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n351 km\n\n3h 12min\n\n15 min\n\n195 km\n\n1h 46min\n\n308 km\n\n2h 48min\n\n15 min\n\n171 km\n\n1h 33min\n\n 479 km \n (4h 36min)\n \n\n275 km\n\n2h 30min\n\n15 min\n\n152 km\n\n1h 23min\n\n 427 km \n (4h 8min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 546 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 479 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 427 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i5 M60 xDrive Touring\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined.

The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i4 eDrive35 \n \n\n 3 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n368 km\n\n3h 21min\n\n15 min\n\n195 km\n\n1h 46min\n\n318 km\n\n2h 53min\n\n15 min\n\n168 km\n\n1h 32min\n\n 486 km \n (4h 40min)\n \n\n280 km\n\n2h 33min\n\n15 min\n\n148 km\n\n1h 21min\n\n 428 km \n (4h 9min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 563 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 486 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 428 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i4 eDrive35, which was available to order from November 2022 until May 2024. \n The previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW i4 eDrive35 \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i4 eDrive35\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 xDrive40. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 xDrive40 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n19 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n38 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n56 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h45m\n\n56 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 xDrive40.\n\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale.

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 M50. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 M50 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n11 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n17 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n35 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n51 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h45m\n\n51 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 M50.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%\nTime: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%\nRate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nAvg. \nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nCCS \n(50 kW DC)\n\n50 kW\n\n50 kW\n\n72 min\n\n260 km/h\n\nCCS \n(100 kW DC)\n\n100 kW\n\n85 kW †\n\n42 min\n\n450 km/h\n\nCCS \n(150 kW DC)\n\n150 kW\n\n105 kW †\n\n34 min\n\n550 km/h\n\nCCS \n(175 kW DC)\n\n175 kW\n\n120 kW †\n\n30 min\n\n630 km/h\n\nCCS \n(350 kW DC)\n\n205 kW †\n\n130 kW †\n\n28 min\n\n670 km/h\n\n This vehicle supports Autocharge \n \n\n This vehicle supports Plug & Charge \n \n\n† = Limited by charging capabilities of vehicle\nAutocharge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations.\nPlug & Charge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations in accordance with ISO 15118.\nActual charging rates may differ from data shown due to factors like outside temperature, state of the battery and driving style.\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nThe table below shows the claimed specifications from the manufacturer for charging the BMW i4 M50. The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 30 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i4 M50 \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n383 km\n\n3h 29min\n\n15 min\n\n205 km\n\n1h 52min\n\n335 km\n\n3h 3min\n\n15 min\n\n179 km\n\n1h 38min\n\n 514 km \n (4h 56min)\n \n\n297 km\n\n2h 42min\n\n15 min\n\n159 km\n\n1h 27min\n\n 457 km \n (4h 24min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 588 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 514 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 457 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i4 M50, which was available to order from November 2021 until May 2024. \n The previous model had similar range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW i4 M50 \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i4 M50\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nStandard 11.0 kW On-Board Charger\n\n \n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n11 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n17 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n34 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n50 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h45m\n\n50 km/h\n\nOptional 22.0kW On-Board Charger\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n11 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n17 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n34 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n50 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n4h30m\n\n98 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 30 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring \n \n\n 3 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n369 km\n\n3h 21min\n\n15 min\n\n204 km\n\n1h 51min\n\n323 km\n\n2h 56min\n\n15 min\n\n179 km\n\n1h 38min\n\n 502 km \n (4h 49min)\n \n\n288 km\n\n2h 37min\n\n15 min\n\n159 km\n\n1h 27min\n\n 447 km \n (4h 19min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 574 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 502 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 447 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i5 xDrive40 Touring\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX xDrive45. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX xDrive45.\n\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 175 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 34 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW iX xDrive45 \n \n\n 3 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n391 km\n\n3h 33min\n\n15 min\n\n167 km\n\n1h 31min\n\n343 km\n\n3h 7min\n\n15 min\n\n147 km\n\n1h 20min\n\n 490 km \n (4h 42min)\n \n\n306 km\n\n2h 47min\n\n15 min\n\n131 km\n\n1h 11min\n\n 436 km \n (4h 13min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 559 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 490 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 436 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX xDrive40, which was available to order from October 2021 until January 2025. \n The previous model had 110 km less range, 20% slower acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW iX xDrive40 \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW iX xDrive45\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW iX xDrive60 \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n436 km\n\n3h 58min\n\n15 min\n\n194 km\n\n1h 46min\n\n384 km\n\n3h 29min\n\n15 min\n\n170 km\n\n1h 33min\n\n 554 km \n (5h 17min)\n \n\n342 km\n\n3h 7min\n\n15 min\n\n152 km\n\n1h 23min\n\n 494 km \n (4h 45min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 630 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 554 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 494 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX xDrive50, which was available to order from November 2021 until January 2025. \n The previous model had 20 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW iX xDrive50 \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW iX xDrive60\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Sedan.\n\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range.

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nStandard 11.0 kW On-Board Charger\n\n \n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n11 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n18 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n36 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n53 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h45m\n\n53 km/h\n\nOptional 22.0kW On-Board Charger\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n11 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n18 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n36 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n53 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n4h30m\n\n100 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 30 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n395 km\n\n3h 35min\n\n15 min\n\n219 km\n\n1h 59min\n\n345 km\n\n3h 8min\n\n15 min\n\n191 km\n\n1h 44min\n\n 536 km \n (5h 7min)\n \n\n306 km\n\n2h 47min\n\n15 min\n\n169 km\n\n1h 32min\n\n 475 km \n (4h 34min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 614 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 536 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 475 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan (MY24), which was available to order from January 2022 until February 2025. \n The previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan \n(MY24)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i5 xDrive40 Sedan\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n10 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n17 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n33 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n49 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n4h30m\n\n96 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 30 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan \n \n\n 3 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n360 km\n\n3h 16min\n\n15 min\n\n199 km\n\n1h 49min\n\n314 km\n\n2h 51min\n\n15 min\n\n174 km\n\n1h 35min\n\n 488 km \n (4h 41min)\n \n\n279 km\n\n2h 32min\n\n15 min\n\n154 km\n\n1h 24min\n\n 433 km \n (4h 11min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 559 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 488 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 433 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan (MY23-24), which was available to order from May 2023 until April 2025. \n The previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan \n(MY23-24)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i5 M60 xDrive Sedan\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection.

Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 30 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n391 km\n\n3h 33min\n\n15 min\n\n216 km\n\n1h 58min\n\n341 km\n\n3h 6min\n\n15 min\n\n189 km\n\n1h 43min\n\n 529 km \n (5h 4min)\n \n\n302 km\n\n2h 45min\n\n15 min\n\n167 km\n\n1h 31min\n\n 469 km \n (4h 31min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 607 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 529 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 469 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring (MY24), which was available to order from February 2024 until April 2025. \n The previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW i5 eDrive40 Touring \n(MY24)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i5 eDrive40 Touring\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n379 km\n\n3h 27min\n\n15 min\n\n210 km\n\n1h 54min\n\n330 km\n\n3h 0min\n\n15 min\n\n183 km\n\n1h 40min\n\n 513 km \n (4h 55min)\n \n\n292 km\n\n2h 39min\n\n15 min\n\n162 km\n\n1h 28min\n\n 454 km \n (4h 22min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 588 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 513 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 454 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring (MY24), which was available to order from January 2022 until February 2025. \n The previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was 3% less energy efficient.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW i5 xDrive40 Touring \n(MY24)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i5 xDrive40 Touring\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 eDrive35. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 eDrive35 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n34h30m\n\n13 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n21h30m\n\n20 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h45m\n\n40 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7h15m\n\n60 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n7h15m\n\n60 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 eDrive35.\n\nMax.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined.

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 eDrive40. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 eDrive40 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n13 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n20 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n40 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n60 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h45m\n\n60 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 eDrive40.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%\nTime: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%\nRate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nAvg. \nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nCCS \n(50 kW DC)\n\n50 kW\n\n50 kW\n\n72 min\n\n300 km/h\n\nCCS \n(100 kW DC)\n\n100 kW\n\n85 kW †\n\n42 min\n\n520 km/h\n\nCCS \n(150 kW DC)\n\n150 kW\n\n105 kW †\n\n34 min\n\n640 km/h\n\nCCS \n(175 kW DC)\n\n175 kW\n\n120 kW †\n\n30 min\n\n730 km/h\n\nCCS \n(350 kW DC)\n\n205 kW †\n\n130 kW †\n\n28 min\n\n780 km/h\n\n This vehicle supports Autocharge \n \n\n This vehicle supports Plug & Charge \n \n\n† = Limited by charging capabilities of vehicle\nAutocharge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations.\nPlug & Charge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations in accordance with ISO 15118.\nActual charging rates may differ from data shown due to factors like outside temperature, state of the battery and driving style.\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nThe table below shows the claimed specifications from the manufacturer for charging the BMW i4 eDrive40. The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 30 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i4 eDrive40 \n \n\n 4 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n446 km\n\n4h 3min\n\n15 min\n\n239 km\n\n2h 10min\n\n387 km\n\n3h 31min\n\n15 min\n\n207 km\n\n1h 53min\n\n 595 km \n (5h 39min)\n \n\n342 km\n\n3h 6min\n\n15 min\n\n183 km\n\n1h 40min\n\n 525 km \n (5h 1min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 685 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 595 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 525 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i4 eDrive40, which was available to order from June 2024 until July 2025. \n The previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW i4 eDrive40 \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i4 eDrive40\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Average energy consumption and range based on moderate drive style and climate. Real-life values may differ significantly. Pricing information might not be actual for some regions. No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 xDrive40. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 xDrive40 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n19 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n38 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n57 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h45m\n\n57 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW i4 xDrive40.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%\nTime: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%\nRate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nAvg. \nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nCCS \n(50 kW DC)\n\n50 kW\n\n50 kW\n\n72 min\n\n280 km/h\n\nCCS \n(100 kW DC)\n\n100 kW\n\n85 kW †\n\n42 min\n\n490 km/h\n\nCCS \n(150 kW DC)\n\n150 kW\n\n105 kW †\n\n34 min\n\n610 km/h\n\nCCS \n(175 kW DC)\n\n175 kW\n\n120 kW †\n\n30 min\n\n690 km/h\n\nCCS \n(350 kW DC)\n\n205 kW †\n\n130 kW †\n\n28 min\n\n740 km/h\n\n This vehicle supports Autocharge \n \n\n This vehicle supports Plug & Charge \n \n\n† = Limited by charging capabilities of vehicle\nAutocharge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations.\nPlug & Charge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations in accordance with ISO 15118.\nActual charging rates may differ from data shown due to factors like outside temperature, state of the battery and driving style.\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nThe table below shows the claimed specifications from the manufacturer for charging the BMW i4 xDrive40. The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 30 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i4 xDrive40 \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n423 km\n\n3h 51min\n\n15 min\n\n227 km\n\n2h 4min\n\n367 km\n\n3h 20min\n\n15 min\n\n197 km\n\n1h 47min\n\n 563 km \n (5h 22min)\n \n\n324 km\n\n2h 57min\n\n15 min\n\n173 km\n\n1h 35min\n\n 497 km \n (4h 47min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 650 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 563 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 497 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i4 xDrive40, which was available to order from January 2022 until July 2025. \n The previous model had 5 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW i4 xDrive40 \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i4 xDrive40\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW i4 M60 xDrive. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW i4 M60 xDrive can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n41h45m\n\n11 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n26 hours\n\n18 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n13 hours\n\n36 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n8h45m\n\n53 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n8h45m\n\n53 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 205 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 30 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW i4 M60 xDrive \n \n\n 3.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n391 km\n\n3h 33min\n\n15 min\n\n210 km\n\n1h 54min\n\n340 km\n\n3h 6min\n\n15 min\n\n182 km\n\n1h 39min\n\n 523 km \n (5h 0min)\n \n\n301 km\n\n2h 44min\n\n15 min\n\n161 km\n\n1h 28min\n\n 462 km \n (4h 27min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 601 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 523 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 462 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW i4 M50, which was available to order from June 2024 until July 2025. \n The previous model had 15 km less range, 5% slower acceleration and was 3% less energy efficient.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW i4 M50 \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW i4 M60 xDrive\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW iX3 50 xDrive \n \n\n 5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n512 km\n\n4h 39min\n\n15 min\n\n338 km\n\n3h 5min\n\n447 km\n\n4h 4min\n\n15 min\n\n295 km\n\n2h 41min\n\n 742 km \n (7h 0min)\n \n\n396 km\n\n3h 36min\n\n15 min\n\n262 km\n\n2h 23min\n\n 658 km \n (6h 14min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 850 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 742 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 658 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX3 (MY22-24), which was available to order from September 2021 until October 2024. \n The previous model had 225 km less range, 39% slower acceleration and was 8% less energy efficient.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW iX3 \n(MY22-24)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW iX3 50 xDrive\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX1 xDrive30. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX1 xDrive30 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nStandard 11.0 kW On-Board Charger\n\n \n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n33h30m\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n20h45m\n\n19 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h30m\n\n37 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7 hours\n\n56 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n7 hours\n\n56 km/h\n\nOptional 22.0kW On-Board Charger\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n33h30m\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n20h45m\n\n19 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h30m\n\n37 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7 hours\n\n56 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n3h30m\n\n110 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX1 xDrive30.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax.

How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW iX1 xDrive30 \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n324 km\n\n2h 57min\n\n15 min\n\n156 km\n\n1h 25min\n\n283 km\n\n2h 35min\n\n15 min\n\n136 km\n\n1h 14min\n\n 419 km \n (4h 4min)\n \n\n252 km\n\n2h 17min\n\n15 min\n\n121 km\n\n1h 6min\n\n 373 km \n (3h 38min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 480 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 419 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 373 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX1 xDrive30 (MY23-25), which was available to order from November 2022 until February 2026. \n The previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW iX1 xDrive30 \n(MY23-25)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW iX1 xDrive30\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

No rights can be derived from the information on this site. \n\nHome and Destination Charging (0 -> 100%)\n\nCharging is possible by using a regular wall plug or a charging station. Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX2 eDrive20. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX2 eDrive20 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nStandard 11.0 kW On-Board Charger\n\n \n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n33h30m\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n20h45m\n\n20 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h30m\n\n39 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7 hours\n\n58 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n7 hours\n\n58 km/h\n\nOptional 22.0kW On-Board Charger\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n33h30m\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n20h45m\n\n20 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h30m\n\n39 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7 hours\n\n58 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n3h30m\n\n110 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX2 eDrive20.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg.

The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 130 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 29 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW iX2 eDrive20 \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n341 km\n\n3h 6min\n\n15 min\n\n164 km\n\n1h 29min\n\n296 km\n\n2h 41min\n\n15 min\n\n142 km\n\n1h 17min\n\n 437 km \n (4h 13min)\n \n\n261 km\n\n2h 22min\n\n15 min\n\n125 km\n\n1h 8min\n\n 386 km \n (3h 45min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 505 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 437 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 386 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX2 eDrive20 (MY23-25), which was available to order from January 2024 until February 2026. \n The previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW iX2 eDrive20 \n(MY23-25)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW iX2 eDrive20\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",

Public charging is always done through a charging station. How fast the EV can charge depends on the charging station (EVSE) used and the maximum charging capacity of the EV. The table below shows all possible options for charging the BMW iX2 xDrive30. Each option shows how fast the battery can be charged from empty to full.\n\nEurope\n\nCharging an EV in Europe differs by country. Some European countries primarily use 1-phase connections to the grid, while other countries are almost exclusively using a 3-phase connection. The table below shows all possible ways the BMW iX2 xDrive30 can be charged, but some modes of charging might not be widely available in certain countries.\n\nType 2 (Mennekes - IEC 62196)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nStandard 11.0 kW On-Board Charger\n\n \n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n33h30m\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n20h45m\n\n19 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h30m\n\n38 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7 hours\n\n56 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW †\n\n7 hours\n\n56 km/h\n\nOptional 22.0kW On-Board Charger\n\nWall Plug \n(2.3 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x10A\n\n2.3 kW\n\n33h30m\n\n12 km/h\n\n1-phase 16A \n(3.7 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x16A\n\n3.7 kW\n\n20h45m\n\n19 km/h\n\n1-phase 32A \n(7.4 kW)\n\n230V /\n 1x32A\n\n7.4 kW\n\n10h30m\n\n38 km/h\n\n3-phase 16A \n(11 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x16A\n\n11 kW\n\n7 hours\n\n56 km/h\n\n3-phase 32A \n(22 kW)\n\n400V /\n 3x32A\n\n22 kW †\n\n3h30m\n\n110 km/h\n\n† = Limited by on-board charger, vehicle cannot charge faster.\n\n(Advertisement)\n\nFast Charging (10 -> 80%)\n\nRapid charging enables longer journeys by adding as much range as possible in the shortest amount of time. Charging power will decrease significantly after 80% state-of-charge has been reached. A typical rapid charge therefore rarely exceeds 80% SoC. The rapid charge rate of an EV depends on the charger used and the maximum charging power the EV can handle. The table below shows all details for rapid charging the BMW iX2 xDrive30.\n\nMax. Power: maximum power provided by charge point\nAvg. Power: average power provided by charge point over a session from 10% to 80%\nTime: time needed to charge from 10% to 80%\nRate: average charging speed over a session from 10% to 80%\n\nCombined Charging System (CCS Combo 2)\n\nCharging Point\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nAvg. \nPower\n\nTime\n\nRate\n\nCCS \n(50 kW DC)\n\n50 kW\n\n40 kW †\n\n72 min\n\n230 km/h\n\nCCS \n(100 kW DC)\n\n100 kW\n\n75 kW †\n\n38 min\n\n430 km/h\n\nCCS \n(150 kW DC)\n\n130 kW †\n\n95 kW †\n\n30 min\n\n550 km/h\n\n This vehicle supports Autocharge \n \n\n This vehicle supports Plug & Charge \n \n\n† = Limited by charging capabilities of vehicle\nAutocharge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations.\nPlug & Charge: allows for automatic initiation of a charging session at supported CCS charging stations in accordance with ISO 15118.\nActual charging rates may differ from data shown due to factors like outside temperature, state of the battery and driving style.\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nThe table below shows the claimed specifications from the manufacturer for charging the BMW iX2 xDrive30. The specifications can differ from the table above for a variety of reasons. If real-world charge tests are available, these differences can be signifcant. If no real-world tests are available, the table above will be based on the manufacturer specifications as per the table below.\n\nMax. Power: maximum charge power during charging session\nCharge From: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is started\nCharge To: battery percentage (% SoC) where charging session is ended\nTime: time needed for charging session\n\nBMW Claimed Specifications\n\nMax. \nPower\n\nCharge From\n\nCharge To\n\nTime\n\n 130 kW \n \n\n 10 % \n \n\n 80 % \n \n\n 29 min \n \n\nLong Distance Suitability\n\nHow suitable an electric car is for long trips depends not only on the range. How quickly the car can charge plays an almost equally important role. Whether an EV is suitable for long trips depends on the battery capacity, efficiency, and fast charging capability.\n\nTo easily compare cars among each other, a benchmark has been established that combines these factors into the total distance a vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop: the '1-Stop Range'. Based on the 1-Stop Range, the 5-star rating is determined. The result of the benchmark is shown in the graph below.\n\n1-Stop Range\n\n+\n\nBased on the driving profile and assumptions below, the 1-Stop Range is determined. The sum of the distance covered in both trip legs is the 1-Stop Range. For vehicles that cannot fast charge, only the distance from the first leg applies.\nDriving Profile\nStart with a fully charged battery\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 1)\nFast charge: 15 minutes\nDrive until 10% battery charge is reached (leg 2)\nAssumptions\nSpeed, climate, and external conditions based on Real Range Highway\nNo time required for starting and stopping the charging session\nThe charger can always supply the charging power requested by the vehicle\nThe battery is in optimal condition\nIn practice, it is impossible to exactly meet the driving profile and assumptions. The benchmark is therefore only suitable for comparing vehicles under standardized conditions.\n \n\n5-Star Rating\n\n+\n\nThe 1-Stop Range describes the distance the vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop. To clearly show the impact of temperature, the 1-Stop Range is determined for three weather conditions. These weather conditions are identical to those in the Real Range benchmark. The 1-Stop Range under average conditions determines the number of stars awarded. The star rating provides a quick way to assess whether a car is suitable for long trips compared to other cars.\n\nAssignment of Stars in 2026\n\n 0 \n\n less than 200 km \n\n 1 \n\n from 200 km to 325 km \n\n 2 \n\n from 325 km to 450 km \n\n 3 \n\n from 450 km to 575 km \n\n 4 \n\n from 575 km to 700 km \n\n 5 \n\n more than 700 km \n\n Vehicles with a result between these threshold values receive a rating based on a linear scale. Half stars are possible. \n\nRevision of Rating\n\n+\n\nAnnual Revision\nThe technology of electric cars is developing rapidly. To ensure that the rating remains relevant, the threshold values are evaluated annually. These threshold values apply to all vehicles, including used vehicles. This makes it possible to compare each car against each other based on the current state of technology.\n1-Stop Range\nThe underlying 1-Stop Range is not revised annually. The total distance that a specific vehicle can cover with one 15-minute charging stop remains the same. If the vehicle itself receives an update that changes the 1-Stop Range, then this change will also be reflected in the rating. \n\n BMW iX2 xDrive30 \n \n\n 2.5 / 5\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n333 km\n\n3h 2min\n\n15 min\n\n160 km\n\n1h 27min\n\n290 km\n\n2h 38min\n\n15 min\n\n139 km\n\n1h 16min\n\n 429 km \n (4h 9min)\n \n\n256 km\n\n2h 20min\n\n15 min\n\n123 km\n\n1h 7min\n\n 379 km \n (3h 42min)\n \n\n0 km\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n700\n\n800\n\nMild Weather\n\n 493 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nAverage Conditions\n\n 429 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\nCold Weather\n\n 379 km \n 1-Stop Range \n\n \n\nPreceding model\n\n The model shown on this page is the successor of the BMW iX2 xDrive30 (MY23-25), which was available to order from October 2023 until February 2026. \n The previous model had 10 km less range, same acceleration and was similar in energy consumption.\n \n\n Preceding model BMW iX2 xDrive30 \n(MY23-25)\n \n\n \n\n(Advertisement)\n\nBMW iX2 xDrive30\n\nBattery Electric Vehicle\n\nCHEATSHEETS\n \nMISSING VEHICLES\n \nDATA SERVICES\n\nCONTACT & ABOUT\n\nDISCLAIMER\n \n \n\nEuropean Overview\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nGermany\n\n ©2026 EV Database - v5.1.0\n \n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX\n\nCompare",
